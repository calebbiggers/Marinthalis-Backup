# The Iron Tide

![[the-iron-tide.webp|float-right|300]]A ship in the fleet of [[The Whisper Pirates]]. Captained by [[Yaw'goo Bhagar]].

## Description

>[!reading]
>The *Iron Tide* is a smaller ship, though it bears little resemblance to the sleek vessels that normally sail the seas. This ship is a patchwork of iron and wood, its hull crudely repaired over the years with rusting iron plates bolted into place, giving it a jagged, almost armored appearance. The once-sturdy wooden planks are now interspersed with metal patches, each repair seemingly more haphazard than the last.
>
>The ship’s deck is scarred and weather-beaten, with uneven railings and mismatched sails that flap stiffly in the wind. The iron reinforcements extend to the masts and rigging, creating an ominous clank whenever the ship rocks with the waves. Despite its rough and ragged appearance, *The Iron Tide* remains seaworthy, a testament to its resilience and Yaw’goo’s refusal to let time or battle destroy it.
