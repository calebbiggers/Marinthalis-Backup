# Kletva

A small and mostly-destroyed town acting as a place of refuge for the remaining inhabitants of Stygia. The town is the only settlement on the island. Mostly in ruins, the survivors have built up a tall wooden barricade encompassing a hill where the town chapel is in order to protect them from the shadow-plague affecting the island.

# Story

The [[Groups/The Pegging Pirates]] arrived in Kletva after entering [[The Wild Tempest]]. [[Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] had been to the island before as it was where he received his magical injury.

The players helped out the town, eventually defeating [[Shirina]] and ending the shadow plague. As payment, [[Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] paid them and promised to construct an obsidian statue of the party in the town square.
