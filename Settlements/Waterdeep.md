# Waterdeep

![[waterdeep-city-image.webp|border]]
Like [[#Siroccia]], Waterdeep is located within [[#The Wild Tempest]]. However, this island is unique. It is less of an island and more of a city, lying deep beneath the sea on the ocean floor directly beneath one edge of [[#The Midtempest Boundary]]. The city thrives on the trade between explorers venturing further into the storm, sailors travelling to sell their wares, and those who dwell beneath the waves. Additionally, there is a large tourism industry, with many from all over Marinthalis willing to risk travelling within the tempest in order to witness the city's spectacle.

Originally a [[Elf#Sea Elves|Sea Elf]] city, through the exploration of the Tempest, the small village quickly grew to the expansive underwater metropolis it is today. There is still a large Aquafolk population, with Sea Elves being the majority. Nowadays, in order to accommodate those who cannot breath underwater, sections of the city are encompassed by large air bubbles, allowing those of land-based lineage to survive on the sea floor.
