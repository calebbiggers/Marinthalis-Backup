# Canalla

On the coast of [[Dragon Turtle’s Rest]] lies Canalla, the island’s only large settlement. Widely considered a lawless and bustling city, Canalla thrives on the trade of illegal goods, stolen treasures, and pirate dealings. The streets are packed with sailors, pirates, and merchants, all looking to make a fortune away from the prying eyes of [[The Council of Isles]]. Though lacking the stability of cities protected by [[The Isleguard]], Canalla has its own unspoken rules and alliances that keep the chaotic port functioning. It’s a place of opportunity for those willing to take risks, but also a city where betrayal and violence are never far away.
