## 2. Crystal Oasis Spa

- **Mirage Massage** - A rejuvenating full-body massage using desert herbs and oils that are cooling and soothing. The oils are often mixed with infused waters from rare desert plants. The massage technique is designed to ease muscle stiffness from long days in the heat and desert travel.

## 3. The Mirage & Moor

![[xara-barazi.png]]
- **Building Style:** The inn is constructed of thick, sun-baked adobe, with high ceilings to allow warm air to rise and cooler breezes to flow through. The building has a large courtyard in the center where guests can relax in the shade of large palm trees and arched awnings. The exterior is adorned with woven tapestries that reflect the sun’s glare in a way that creates an illusion of shimmering heat mirages.
- **Signage:** The sign is a carved wooden plank, hanging from a wrought-iron post. It shows an elegant mirage of an oasis, with a lone traveler resting near a small pool of water—both artfully painted with a shimmering sheen.
- **Interior Decor:** The interior is adorned with cool, sandy colors—earthy beige and soft reds—designed to make patrons feel refreshed and relaxed. Rattan furniture with cushioned seats fills the spacious room. The air smells of incense, dried herbs, and faint traces of spices from the kitchen.
- **Ambiance:** Soft, melodic desert music often plays in the background, a combination of wind instruments and the gentle hum of strings. The dim light inside is created by hanging lanterns that give off a warm, flickering glow, contrasting with the harsh daylight outside.

- **Harvesting:** Takes specialized tools or trained arbormancers to harvest fruit from heights. Fruit must be gathered by moonlight to preserve magical potency in some varieties.
- **Fermentation:** The juice is often mixed with barrelbark sap, which acts as a natural fermenting agent. The sap has mild preservative or alchemical properties.
- **Aging:** Wine is aged in casks made _from_ barrelbark wood, believed to "listen" and subtly enhance the wine’s essence over time.
- **Tasting Rituals:** Wine must be swirled counterclockwise and inhaled with eyes closed to "wake the notes"—a local superstition that became tradition.

- Item shop

## 14. Faelar Orchard

- Orchard owned by someone named Faelar

## 15. Crystal Current Couriers

Operating from a modest, well-kept adobe warehouse and dock nestled along Seaglass’s waterfront is Crystal Current Couriers. Painted in shades of faded turquoise and white, the building blends easily among other merchant businesses. The interior is neatly arranged with stacked crates, barrels, and shipping manifests—though careful inspection would reveal coded markings and hidden compartments used to smuggle stolen or illicit goods. At any given time, a handful of workers dressed as dockhands and clerks manage the business; most are legitimate employees unaware of the guild’s true nature.

## 16. Runehammer Forge

- Blacksmith shop owned by a dwarf named Orin Grimbuckle
