>While wearing this magic ring, the user can speak its command word to [[Glossary#Shape-Shifting|Shape Shift]] into a new form in the likeness of another creature as if by the spell [[Polymorph]]. Each rings likeness is selected upon creation and cannot be changed.
>
>The wearers's game statistics are replaced by the stat block of this new forms likeness, but the wearer retains its alignment, personality, creature type, Hit Points, and Hit Point Dice. Any gear being worn by the wearer melds into the new form. This new form can't use or otherwise benefit from any of this equipment.
>
>While wearing the ring, the user can again speak the command word to shape-shift back into their true form.
