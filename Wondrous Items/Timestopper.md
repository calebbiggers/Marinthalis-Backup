>This firearm doesn’t use traditional ammunition. Instead, it shoots bullets made of sand, fed by small hourglass-shaped ampoules full of sand, which you replace whenever you reload the weapon. You gain a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this magic weapon. This weapon has 3 charges, and regains all expended charges daily at dawn.
>
>**_Future Problem._** When you hit with an attack roll using this weapon, you can expend 1 charge to cause the bullet to be sent into the future just before making contact with the target. This delays the hit and deals no damage to the target. At the start of your next turn, the bullet reappears and hits the target, dealing its normal damage plus an extra 3d6 Force damage.
>
>**_Temporal Bifurcation._** Whenever you score a [[Damage & Healing#Critical Hits|Critical Hit]] with this magic weapon, the bullet splits in two. One of the bullets hit the target, dealing the normal [[Damage & Healing#Critical Hits|Critical Damage]], while the other is sent into the future as per the **Future Problem** property. The future bullet’s damage does not benefit from the critical hit bonus.
