> The front of this armor is adorned with a large shell design, which covers your chest. The metal has a pearlescent shimmer. You gain a +1 bonus to AC while wearing this armor. In addition, you can breathe underwater and gain a swimming speed equal to your walking speed.
>
>The armor has 4 charges and regains 1d4 expended charges daily at dawn. If you're within 100 feet of a natural body of sea water at that time, it regains all expended charges instead. While wearing the armor, you can use your reaction when you take fire damage to expend 1 of the armor's charges to halve the fire damage you take from the triggering effect.
