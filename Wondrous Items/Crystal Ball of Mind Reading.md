# Crystal Ball of Mind Reading

>[!legendary-wondrous-item-callout] Crystal Ball of Mind Reading
>_Wondrous Item, Legendary (Requires Attunement)_
>
>While touching this crystal orb, you can cast [[Scrying]] (save DC 17) with it. In addition, you can cast [[Detect Thoughts]] (save DC 17) targeting creatures you can see within 30 feet of the spell's sensor. You don't need to concentrate on this [[Detect Thoughts]] spell to maintain it during its duration, but it ends if the [[Scrying]] spell ends.
