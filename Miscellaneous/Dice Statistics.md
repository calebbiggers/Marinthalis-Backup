# Dice Statistics

![[dice-2.png]]

To calculate the average results of a given dice, you sum all elements of the collection, then divide that by the number of elements.

>[!example] Example: 1d4
>$$\begin{gather*}
>\text{A d4 represents the collection $\{1,2,3,4\}$, therefore its average is:} \\
>\\
>\dfrac{1+2+3+4}{4}=\dfrac{10}{4}=2.5 \\
>\end{gather*}$$

## Dice Averages

| Dice | Average Value |
|:----:|:-------------:|
| 1d4  |      2.5      |
| 1d6  |      3.5      |
| 1d8  |      4.5      |
| 1d10 |      5.5      |
| 1d12 |      6.5      |
| 1d20 |     10.5      |

## Advantage & Disadvantage

Statistically, having advantage or disadvantage on a d20 roll, averages to a +5/-5 bonus the closer to the center the target is. If the target is 11, advantage is about the same as a +5 bonus. However, if the target is a 20, then advantage only gives the same advantage as a +1 bonus.
