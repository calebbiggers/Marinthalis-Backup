|      | This card symbolizes upheaval, chaos, and sudden, life-altering events. It reflects the tragic loss and trauma Gnar experienced when his family was taken by pirates, shaking the foundations of his life and setting him on his current path. | The Two of Swords signifies a difficult decision or an inner conflict. Gnar is currently facing a crossroads, needing to find clarity amid conflicting loyalties or goals. This card emphasizes the importance of seeing things from multiple perspectives and making careful, balanced choices. | This reversed card signals impulsiveness and unchecked aggression, warning that if Gnar lets his drive for revenge go unchecked, he may act recklessly, risking harm to himself and others. It suggests a potential future where his rage could blind him, leading to hasty actions with dire consequences. |

|        | The Star, upright, symbolizes hope, healing, and divine protection. This card reflects how Shtepi was blessed and safeguarded from the shadow plague by his deity, Oghma, allowing him to survive the dark forces around him. It emphasizes the guidance and support he's received in his journey as a healer and scholar. | The Devil represents temptation, bondage, and the darker side of the self. In Shtepi's present, this card suggests he is facing his own inner demons, grappling with addiction, fear, or inner turmoil that keeps him shackled. It reflects the struggle within him to overcome a dark influence or the shadowy parts of his own psyche, perhaps stemming from his injuries and dependence on pain-relieving concoctions. The Devil warns that he must confront these inner chains if he is to move forward, as they risk consuming him if left unchecked. | Death as Shtepi’s future card is powerful and transformative, representing change, endings, and rebirth. This card doesn’t necessarily mean literal death but rather suggests a profound shift or conclusion in his journey. For Shtepi, Death could signify the potential end of his current life as he knows it—either through the shadow curse reaching a final stage or a drastic transformation that forces him to shed parts of himself to find peace or a cure. |

This card represents Keiran’s current state, where she is beginning to harness and unlock her abilities, channeling her newfound power with intention. It highlights her realization of her potential and her readiness to bring it into action, marking her transformation from someone limited by circumstance to someone actively creating her path. | The Page of Swords is a symbol of intellect, clarity, and decisiveness. In Keiran’s future, this card suggests she will succeed by trusting her intelligence, creativity, and perceptive mind. The Queen of Swords encourages her to use her knowledge and innovative thinking, blending wisdom with practical action. It promises that if she trusts in her cleverness and resourcefulness, she will navigate challenges with clarity and purpose. |
