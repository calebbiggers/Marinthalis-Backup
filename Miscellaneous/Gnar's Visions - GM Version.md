# Gnar's Visions

[[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] Periodically has visions in his dreams. The goal of these visions is to show Gnar that his mother is alive in [[The Wild Tempest]] and to drive him to explore it.

## Vision 1

Gnar awakes seemingly inside a wild storm. He is floating above the sea with nothing but wind, rain, and waves around him.

## Vision 2

Gnar again awakes inside the Wild Tempest. Suddenly his perspective moves as if he is travelling through the storm. Arriving at what seems to be a wall of storm, within the fog he sees the silhouette of a halfling woman.

## Vision 3

>[!reading]
>As you slip into unconsciousness, your mind plunges into the storm once again—wild, furious, and untamed. You’re suddenly awake, but not upon your ship with your friends. Instead, you find yourself standing amidst the heart of a violent tempest. The wind howls around you, tugging at your clothes, whipping your hair as rain hits your skin. Lightning cracks across the sky, illuminating the chaos for brief moments before plunging you back into the near-darkness of the storm.
>
>Your vision is pulled forward, as if you are moving through the storm without effort, carried along by the ferocious winds. The chaos swirls around you, growing denser, and ahead you see something unnatural—a wall of wind and fog, a dense curtain swirling before you, impossibly high and thick, blocking out everything beyond it.
>
>The moment you approach the wall, everything feels… still. The wind dies, the roar of the storm fades to a distant murmur, and in the thick fog before you, a shadow moves. A silhouette. You've seen this vision before, but unlike previously you can clearly recognize the form of your mother within the fog. She stands just beyond the wall of fog, her figure flickering in and out of focus, as if she is part of the tempest itself.
>
>“Gnar, my son…” Her voice is both familiar and distant, echoing from somewhere beyond the storm. You see her hand reach out through the fog, thin and ghostly, just beyond your grasp. In her hand you see her old oracle sticks, the same ones you carry with you to this day.
>
>“You have the gift…” she says, her voice calm but tinged with urgency. “You can find me. You must enter the storm…”
>
>The wind picks up again, but not with the same wild ferocity. It’s as if the storm itself is waiting for you to step forward, to answer her call. Her silhouette wavers, disappearing for a moment before reappearing, further away now, as if the tempest is pulling her deeper into its heart.
>
>“I’m waiting for you, my son…” The fog thickens, her voice becoming softer, more distant. Her hand fades into the swirling mists.
>
>And just like that, her figure disappears completely, swallowed by the storm. The winds roar back to life, the rain pelting your skin as the chaos of the tempest surges once again.
>
>Suddenly, everything goes dark. You awaken with a start, drenched in sweat, the roar of the storm still echoing in your ears.
