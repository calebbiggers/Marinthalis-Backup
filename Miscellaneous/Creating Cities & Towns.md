# Creating Cities & Towns

![[cities-art.png]]

## G.U.A.R.D.S. Method

A city needs 6 things:
- **Government Buildings.** Whether it’s a humble town hall for a small village, or the castle of a king, you need a palace where you can talk to the local authorities.
- **Underworld Activities.** Every fantasy town harbors secrets, from discrete fences in alleyways to expansive thieves’ guilds, every town needs a place where you can talk to a shady character outside the law’s watchful eye.
- **Altars.** Whether it’s a simple shrine in a small town or a majestic cathedral, the town needs a place where the locals can worship the divine. Here you can get leads from not only the locals, but from the deities that they serve.
- **Resources.** From bustling trade districts in grand kingdoms to quaint general stores in smaller settlements, there needs to be a place where the locals can trade services and information that the party can make sue of on their journey.
- **Defenses.** Whether its the sheriff’s office in a small town, or a military barrack for an army protecting a kingdom, every fantasy town needs some kind of safeguard. There is always a looming threat and the people you find here will be on the frontline of that conflict.
- **Social Hubs.** From a cozy inn in a hamlet to a bustling entertainment district in a kingdom. These social hubs provide opportunities for role-playing, interactions, and memorable moments.

## Size & Population

The Settlements by Size table provides population ranges for villages, towns, and cities as well as the value of the most expensive item the settlement is likely to have for sale. Adjust these numbers as you wish to account for special circumstances. For example, a [[Potion of Healing]] (which costs 50 GP) is too expensive an item to purchase in most villages, but a village that happens to have an alchemist, an herbalist, or a potion brewer might have one or more such potions for sale.

### Settlements by Size

| Settlement Size |   Population   | Max GP Value |
|:---------------:|:--------------:|:------------:|
| [[#Settlement]] |      <20       |     5 GP     |
|   [[#Thorp]]    |     20-60      |    10 GP     |
|   [[#Hamlet]]   |     60-120     |    20 GP     |
|  [[#Village]]   |    120-500     |    200 GP    |
| [[#Small Town]] |   500-2,000    |    800 GP    |
| [[#Large Town]] |  2,000-5,000   |   2,000 GP   |
| [[#Small City]] |  5,000-10,000  |  70,000 GP   |
| [[#Large City]] | 10,000-25,000  |  200,000 GP  |
| [[#Metropolis]] | 25,000-100,000 |    No Max    |
|  [[#Megacity]]  |    100,000+    |    No Max    |

### Settlement

A settlement is a very small group of people who have banded together to form a new place to live. Most often numbering 20 people or fewer, a settlement is not going to have the trappings of an established city. They may not even have a mayor. Or a bar. Settlements are most likely to be found in remote places a good distance away from the heard of their respective civilization, but typically exist for a reason. Perhaps they are close to a crossroads or natural wonder, or it’s possible the settlement is a front for an underground city. When developing a settlement, think about why the folks who dwell here choose to stay.

### Thorp

Having a population between 20 and 60 people, a thorp is likely to only be a small collection of buildings and homes. A place like this is normally established near the nexus of valuable resources, be that farmland, mineral mines, or particularly abundant lakes and rivers. A thorp-sized community likely grows out of s small settlement where people stayed to ply their trades and work the land. As their families grew, so did the settlement.

### Hamlet

Numbering between 60 and 120 residents, a habitation of this size could be described as a handful of houses that cluster around a crossroads. While it's likely to be surrounded by farmland and homesteads, it's still some distance away from the next settlement. Attachment to the land and the ability to eke out a meager living from resources in the area kept people in a small place like this for a generation or two, or perhaps there's a resource they benefit from that is particularly valuable, either due to sentiment or forward-thinking.

### Village

A village typically has a population of 120-500 people. The homes are clustered around an important central point in the area like a town hall or a temple. It is likely to have several essential craftsmen as well as a central marketplace. Villages pop up in places of natural convergence and in places where resources are rich and plentiful. Think a comfortable sleepy collection of people on the edge of a great forest full of timber and game or a wind-beaten and sea spray-covered group of houses on a great bay full of small fishing vessels.

### Small Town

A habitation of this size will have between 500 and 2,000 residents. Imagine clusters of homes around important points of interest including a marketplace, town hall, temple and/or port. When resources are plentiful enough, people stay put and small towns grow and thrive. Most of the population in a place like this has lived there for generations during which times they create and develop their own customs and traditions. While it may not have the same defenses as a larger town or city, there may be a small garrison or volunteer guard.

### Large Town

A large town will have a population between 2,000 and 5,000 residents. Likely to have a strong trade system both internally and with neighboring settlements, there will typically be several important points of interest such as a large temple, library or guildhall. A population of this size requires access to enough resources and opportunity for trade to support them. The ability to trade and purchase resources allowed the town to grow and sustain its population. Perhaps this town grew up around a high-yield silver mine and ample farmland or there's a fissure that seeps harnessable arcane energy and a bit of a boomtown has emerged as would-be billionaires stake their claim.

### Small City

A community of this size is going to support a population of between 5,000 and 10,000 residents. There will be numerous taverns and inns supporting all manner of clientele, several important places within the city and a varied economy. There is likely to be significant guild activity, both legal and illegal. A place like this is likely situated on a heavily traveled road or along the side of a great river or beautiful overlook. Plentiful trade in a place like this provides the opportunity to advance and better one's position. It is the kernel of hope that draws people to the city. Finding their fortune (or continuing to chase it) is what keeps them there.

### Large City

To be considered a large city, a municipality will support between 10,000-25,000 residents. The government of such a place will have multiple offices. Temples to numerous gods will be present within the city limits. The economy will have many facets and trade guilds are likely to hold significant sway. A place like this may include more obscure but still vital venues like mage colleges, houses of learning and legendary marketplaces and bazaars. A large city will grow out of an area that has access to numerous types of resources from great fisheries and farms to rich mines and vast forests (or; at the least, a major port where every necessity can be easily shipped in). Generations of leadership that have capitalized on necessary resources through trade and treaties have allowed for continued growth. Growth has allowed the residents of the city to attract specialized merchants, powerful mage guilds, learned scholars and master craftsmen. All of these facts provide even more opportunity (along with opportunities for exploitation).

### Metropolis

Sporting a population of between 25,000 and 100,000 residents, there is little a community this size can't offer. Likely to have significant defenses and military presence, a habitation of this size will be a place to flee to in times of struggle. Likely to support a vastly varied socioeconomic population, a metropolis is a place of vast wealth and extreme poverty. Time and opportunity have allowed for a large city to ever expand its borders and reach. The arts thrive. Businesses do too. So does crime.

### Megacity

With a population numbering more than 100,000 people, a municipality of this nature is likely to be the crown jewel of any country. With vast opportunity, widely varied social structures, heavy guild influence and a host of resources a community like this can provide just about anything from the services of a high-level mage to a black market trade of magical items and strange creatures.
