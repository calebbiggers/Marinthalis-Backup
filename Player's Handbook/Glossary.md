# Glossary

Here are definitions of various rules not found elsewhere.

## Curses

Some game effects curse a creature or an object. The effect that confers a curse defines what the curse does. Curses can be removed by the [[Remove Curse]] and [[Greater Restoration]] spells or other magic that explicitly ends curses.

## Shape-Shifting

If an effect, such as [[Druid#Level 2 Wild Shape|Wild Shape]] or the [[Polymorph]] spell, lets you shape-shift, its description specifies what happens to you. Unless that description says otherwise, any ongoing effects on you—[[Conditions]], [[Spells]], [[#Curses]], and the like—carry over from one form to the other. In most cases, you revert to your true form if you die.
