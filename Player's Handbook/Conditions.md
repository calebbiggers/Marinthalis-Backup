# Conditions

Conditions alter a creature's capabilities in a variety of ways and can arise as a result of a spell, a class feature, a monster's attack, or other effect. Most conditions, such as blinded, are impairments, but a few, such as invisible, can be advantageous.

A condition lasts either until it is countered (the prone condition is countered by standing up, for example) or for a duration specified by the effect that imposed the condition.

If multiple effects impose the same condition on a creature, each instance of the condition has its own duration, but the condition's effects don't get worse. A creature either has a condition or doesn't.

The following definitions specify what happens to a creature while it is subjected to a condition.

## Blinded

## Inebriated

**_Inebriation Levels._** This condition is cumulative. Each time you drink, you must make a Constitution saving throw. The DC for this is calculated below:

$$\text{DC} = 10 + 2 * \text{Current Inebriation Level}$$

**_Effects & D20 Tests._** The various levels of Inebriation have effects on your character. The table below shows the effect of each level. Some levels give penalties or bonuses to [[D20 Tests]]. The formula for these is shown below.

$$\text{Bonus/Penalty} = 2 * \text{Current Inebriation Level}$$
