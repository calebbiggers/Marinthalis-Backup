>[!reading]
>In the city of **Morrow**, where wind and innovation power the lives of its inhabitants, tragedy strikes—a brilliant engineer, **Vina Therianth**, is found murdered in her own workshop. Her longtime business partner, **Caldur Aldoris**, was discovered standing over the body, the scent of oil and treachery thick in the air. With the city’s gears grinding toward a swift conviction, Caldur pleads for outside help to clear his name before the case is sealed shut.

>But in a town built on invention, nothing is ever as it seems. As you delve into the alleys of the Bridge Town, unravel the secrets of its wind-powered wonders, and navigate the tangled web of rival engineers, a bustling town, and mechanical marvels, one question looms:

>Did Caldur truly murder his partner? Or is there more to Vina’s death?

This adventure will be set in the town of [[Morrow]], the main settlement on the island of [[Strauss]]. The town has a unique layout due to its usage of wind power as a source of energy. It is a town of crafting and tinkering. Two of the most well known engineers in the city are [[Vina Therianth]] and [[Caldur Aldoris]].

The gruesome murder of Vina sends a shockwave through the community. Caldur was discovered at the scene of the crime by a neighbor who reported him to the Isleguard. Following a swift arrest, Caldur claims he is innocent.

## The Mystery

### Who Did It?

There are two business partners: [[Vina Therianth]] (She/Her) and [[Caldur Aldoris]] (He/Him). Vina decided to frame Caldur for their own murder so she faked her death and pinned it on Caldur. Vina is also in a secret relationship with their joint apprentice, [[Pax Dornial]] (They/Them). Pax is also in on the scheme, although they did not physically participate in the framing.

#### Clues

- The apprentice, Pax, is a prodigy artificer. They works at the intersection of magic and engineering. Pax will have a real alibi for the murder. However, they designed and created the [[Ring of Reverse Polymorph]].
- There have always been rumors about Caldur and Vina being involved, because it was a well-kept secret that Vina was a lesbian. Caldur will not want to out his late partner, but would given significant pressure or reason.
- Pax is publicly single, but pressing their roommates will have suspicions that they have a secret relationship. Pax will have a stache of love letters from Vina.
- Vina’s home will have a drafting desk with evidence of love letter writing.

### Why Did They Do It?

 Vina is jealous of Caldur due to amount of recognition he gets on their projects (name first on credits, papers; more well known; more skilled an engineer). She wants control of the entire business. The business is left to the apprentice upon the death/imprisonment of Caldur and Vina. Vina and Pax will skip town and set up the shop elsewhere.

#### Clues

- Caldur’s name is **ALWAYS** first on any crediting documentation. ie. Plagues, contracts, blueprints, etc. Caldur has always claimed this is due to the names being in alphabetical order.
- Vina had the original idea for the central kinetic power channel that powers the city, but they worked on and created it together.
- After the murder, Pax publicly plans to leave the city to have a new start elsewhere.

### How Did They Do It?

A [[Ring of Reverse Polymorph]]. Vina used the ring to [[Polymorph]] the neighbors dog (which is now missing) into her likeness, then killed it. She then charmed/drugged the partner near the fake body to be caught.

#### Clues

- The [[Ring of Reverse Polymorph]] will still be on the fake body of Vina if the corpse is inspected. If taken off, the transformation will persist, but the ring could be identified potentially.
- There will be blueprints for the ring in Pax’s research lab/garage/shop that can be discovered.
	- Pax will also have numerous other invented magic items. Maybe all to do with transmutation.
- A neighbors dog will have gone missing the same night of the murder. The dog was given the ring and made to appear like Vina. The neighbor will be an older woman, in the craziness of the murder, no one is paying any attention to her missing dog.
	- Neighbor is who walked in on Caldur standing over the body and reported it to [[The Isleguard]]. She was coming over to look for her dog.
