## Recap

>[!reading]
>Last session, your journey through the Splitroot Highlands took a dramatic turn when a colossal Roc descended from the skies. Seeking refuge, you hid inside Keiran’s rope trick spell while the Roc feasted on a giant carcass it dropped nearby. After a tense wait, your attempt to sneak away failed when Quinn’s misstep revealed your location. A brief but deadly skirmish followed, as the Roc tried to seize you in its massive talons. Barely escaping with your lives, you scared the beast off.
>
>Continuing your journey, the port city of Seaglass came into view—a welcome break from the barren rocky plains you’d been traversing for 2 days. Upon your arrival, Soleit took his leave, returning to his isolated cove to watch over your ship and await your group’s return. After saying your goodbyes, you entered the town welcomed by its open adobe structures and colorful canvas shades. Quinn, although he fumbled through the arrangements, secured two rooms at the local inn, The Mirage and Moore. He noted that the innkeeper mentioned all guests had to be reported to the Isleguard.
>
>Now gathered together in on of your rooms, you now prepare to plan your next move.
