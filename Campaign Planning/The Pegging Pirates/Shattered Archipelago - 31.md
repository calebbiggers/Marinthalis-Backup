# Shattered Archipelago - 31

## Recap

>[!reading]
>Last session, you all arrived in a secluded cove along the rugged coast of Siroccia, seeking refuge from the ever-watchful eyes of the Islguard. The plan was to leave your ship hidden and make the 50-mile trek overland to the town of Seaglass.
>
>However, the cove wasn't as deserted as it seemed. Signs of recent fishing activity led you up a well-worn path, where you discovered a home nestled within a barrelbark tree. There, you met Soleit, an eccentric gnome hermit. He warned you of the dangers lurking in the Splitroot Highlands, particularly the Rocs—massive, predatory birds known to snatch up unsuspecting travelers.
>
>Soleit offered to guide you safely to Seaglass, and you accepted. The journey was arduous but uneventful until you made camp inside a hollowed-out barrelbark tree. That night, you noticed eerie red lights flickering in the distance, but nothing disturbed your rest.
>
>The next day, danger struck. Two nearly invisible, flame-like creatures ambushed you. Their elusive nature made them formidable foes, but Gnar's axe—acquired from Vargen—proved instrumental. Its unique properties disrupted the creatures' invisibility, turning the tide of battle. Keiran's radiant smite further illuminated them, making them easier targets. With Soleit's assistance, you managed to defeat the mysterious attackers.
>
>Now, with the threat behind you and Seaglass drawing nearer, the journey to save Lock's brother continues

## Scenes

### Picking up

Players just defeated the invisible creatures.

### Roc Sighting

A screeching sound will pierce the air around the players as a Roc flies high above their heads. They will need to find cover or be attacked by a Roc.

### Arriving at Seaglass

>[!reading]
>After two days of arduous travel across the Splitroot Highlands, you crest a final ridge and behold the port city of Seaglass. It's clay-built structures rise from the desert floor, their earthen tones blending seamlessly with the surrounding sands. Colorful canopies stretch between buildings, providing much-needed shade over bustling marketplaces and winding alleyways, while the main roads remain exposed under the relentless sun. Beneath your feet, the streets are paved with worn hexagonal tiles, their patterns guiding you deeper into the city's heart. The air carries the mingled scents of spices, sunbaked stone, and distant sea breezes, offering a sensory tapestry that welcomes and intrigues in equal measure.

### 3. The Mirage & Moor

- **Building Style:** The inn is constructed of thick, sun-baked adobe, with high ceilings to allow warm air to rise and cooler breezes to flow through. The building has a large courtyard in the center where guests can relax in the shade of large palm trees and arched awnings. The exterior is adorned with woven tapestries that reflect the sun’s glare in a way that creates an illusion of shimmering heat mirages.
- **Signage:** The sign is a carved wooden plank, hanging from a wrought-iron post. It shows an elegant mirage of an oasis, with a lone traveler resting near a small pool of water—both artfully painted with a shimmering sheen.
- **Interior Decor:** The interior is adorned with cool, sandy colors—earthy beige and soft reds—designed to make patrons feel refreshed and relaxed. Rattan furniture with cushioned seats fills the spacious room. The air smells of incense, dried herbs, and faint traces of spices from the kitchen.
- **Ambiance:** Soft, melodic desert music often plays in the background, a combination of wind instruments and the gentle hum of strings. The dim light inside is created by hanging lanterns that give off a warm, flickering glow, contrasting with the harsh daylight outside.
- **Food:**
	- **Stuffed Dates:** Sweet dates filled with spiced almonds, cinnamon, and a bit of honey.
	- **Flatbreads:** Freshly baked flatbreads served with a variety of dips, such as hummus, roasted pepper paste, or a cooling cucumber-yogurt dip.
	- **Spiced Meats:** Small skewers of grilled lamb or chicken marinated with desert herbs and spices, served with a side of couscous or quinoa salad.
