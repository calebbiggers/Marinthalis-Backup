## General NPCs

1. Olga Hartik

Description: Olga is a wiry, elderly woman with a mane of silver hair tied in a loose braid, deep-set hazel eyes, and rough hands calloused from years of weaving. She wears layers of woolen clothes patched and mended many times over. Olga moves with surprising energy for her age, often seen hobbling briskly through the town square.

Backstory: Once a renowned weaver from a larger town, Olga relocated to Kletva after losing her family to a shadow attack. She now teaches the local children to weave and stitch, passing on her craft and wisdom. Despite her brusque manner, she’s considered the town’s unofficial “grandmother,” dispensing advice as freely as she hands out wool scraps.

2. Fenn Windrider

Description: Fenn is a lanky, middle-aged man with salt-and-pepper stubble and a constant frown etched into his face. He wears worn leather armor and has a habit of chewing on a reed while he watches the coast. His keen blue eyes scan the horizon with the practiced gaze of an experienced scout.

Backstory: A former ranger who patrolled the borders of Kletva, Fenn survived an attack by shadow creatures that claimed his former team. He now volunteers as a lookout, ever vigilant against dark forces. Though he’s a man of few words, Fenn’s quiet loyalty has earned him the respect of the townsfolk.

3. Ilka Sunrose

Description: Ilka is a sturdy woman in her forties with cropped blonde hair, freckles across her nose, and hands rough from years of farming. Her cheerful smile rarely leaves her face, even when she’s knee-deep in soil. She’s always seen in a wide-brimmed straw hat, her arms covered in dirt from tending her garden plots.

Backstory: Ilka was a farmer before the shadow plague reached Kletva, where she once grew herbs and vegetables. After much of her land was overtaken, she now leads community efforts to cultivate what little farmland remains. Her resourcefulness and optimism have made her an essential figure in town.

4. Rurik Blackhorn

Description: Rurik is a grizzled dwarf with a thick, dark beard streaked with grey and a nose that’s been broken more than once. His left arm is fitted with a makeshift metal brace from an old injury. He has a booming laugh and is often found tinkering with old weapons or crafting crude but effective tools.

Backstory: A former blacksmith, Rurik lost his forge when shadow creatures overwhelmed Kletva. Now, he repairs weapons and tools for the townsfolk in exchange for food and supplies. Despite his gruff exterior, he’s fiercely protective of the people of Kletva, especially the younger ones.

5. Sela Moor

Description: Sela is a thin, wiry woman in her thirties with jet-black hair tied into a messy bun and piercing green eyes. She’s often seen cloaked in dark colors, moving quietly from place to place. Her hands are usually ink-stained, and she has an air of mystery that sets her apart from other townsfolk.

Backstory: Once a scribe and archivist, Sela fled to Kletva seeking refuge from the shadow plague. She now maintains the town’s modest records and assists in documenting important events. Her knowledge of the arcane has led some to suspect she may know more about the shadow creatures than she lets on.

6. Jarik Lannard

Description: Jarik is a large, muscular man with a thick brown beard and an easygoing grin. He wears simple tunics with rolled-up sleeves, revealing tattooed forearms. Jarik’s hearty laugh can often be heard at the town’s market or near the harbor, where he works with the fishermen.

Backstory: A former sailor, Jarik settled in Kletva to escape his past life of piracy. Now, he helps organize the town’s dwindling fishing efforts and is skilled at mending nets and boats. He shares tall tales of the sea with anyone who’ll listen, endearing him to children and adults alike.

7. Maelis Fernhollow

Description: Maelis is an elderly elf with long white hair, warm brown eyes, and a serene expression. She wears simple, flowing robes and a necklace of carved wooden beads. Maelis walks with a gentle grace, often stopping to greet the plants and animals around town.

Backstory: Once a healer in a distant elven community, Maelis came to Kletva after a vision led her to help protect its people. She’s known for her herbal remedies and wise words, offering comfort and healing in times of trouble. Maelis is also deeply respected for her knowledge of ancient protective rituals.

8. Todrick Gable

Description: Todrick is a wiry man with sunken cheeks, straw-colored hair, and a nose that looks slightly crooked. He wears patched clothes and fingerless gloves, a constant smirk playing on his face. Todrick is quick with his hands, often twirling a coin or flipping a small dagger.

Backstory: A reformed pickpocket, Todrick turned his life around after a near-fatal encounter with a shadow creature. Now, he acts as Kletva’s messenger and runner, navigating the town’s alleyways with ease. Though some still distrust him, he’s shown his loyalty to Kletva time and time again.

9. Briala Hearthstone

Description: Briala is a young halfling woman with curly brown hair, bright eyes, and a smattering of freckles across her cheeks. She wears a worn leather apron and carries a satchel filled with tools wherever she goes. Her hands are always covered in soot and grease, a testament to her work as a blacksmith’s apprentice.

Backstory: Briala’s family fled to Kletva after losing their home to the shadow plague. She took up an apprenticeship with Rurik to learn blacksmithing, eager to help defend her new home. Despite her small size, she has a fierce spirit and is determined to prove her worth to the town.

10. Father Edric Vale

Description: Father Edric is a tall, thin man with a gaunt face, gray hair, and kind but tired blue eyes. He wears a simple brown robe, adorned with a wooden symbol of his faith, and moves with a quiet dignity. His voice is soft but firm, often heard reciting comforting words to the townsfolk.

Backstory: A priest from a nearby temple, Father Edric came to Kletva to offer spiritual guidance in the face of the shadow plague. He holds regular gatherings and provides counsel to those struggling with grief and fear. Though weary, Father Edric’s steadfast belief in hope and resilience has become a pillar of strength for the community.
