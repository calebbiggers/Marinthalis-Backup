## Recap

>[!reading]
>Last session, with the shadow plague lifted, you all celebrated long into the night—sharing drinks, laughter, and stories with the people of Kletva. The town, once shrouded in despair, began to come back to life—seabirds returned to the skies, greenery pushed through the barren ground, and barricades meant for survival were finally torn down. But as the festivities came to an end, Shtepi made a quiet decision. The next morning, he told you he was staying behind to help rebuild what had been lost. With a bittersweet farewell, you left him behind, the crew now one member fewer as you set sail once again.
>
>A few days into your journey, Gnar’s Wayfinding Oracle Sticks flickered with strange energy, leading you toward a small remote island. On its shore, you found a lone castaway—Kael—who seemed just as surprised to see you as you were to find him. But as you questioned him, something else caught Teeg’s attention: a massive stone boulder, too smooth and precise to be natural. Following the strange markings, you uncovered a hidden staircase leading deep underground into a forgotten temple. Intricate carvings of storms and lightning adorned the cavern, and 4 stone tiles were marked with unknown runes. But before you could decipher their meaning, Kael’s familiar, Poe, stepped onto one of the tiles. Instantly, the entrance sealed shut, the air turned frigid, and ice began to coalesce into the shape of an hulking elemental. The temple’s secrets would have to wait—you had a battle to fight.

### The Four Storms Riddle Again

![[puzzle-runes-dm.png]]
Looking at the carved tile floor, several tiles stand out to you. Four runes are carved into tiles on the floor: Air, Lightning, Rain, and Ice. Carved into the stone wall is the [[Four Storms Puzzle]]. The correct answer is _Air_. Any incorrect answers will activate weather effects and summon a corresponding elemental.

The water and ice elementals will be speaking aquan. They will be saying things like:

>[!reading]
>…Freeze…Crush…Defend…
>…Drown…Break…Protect…
>…Rage…Storm…Guard…

>[!success] Air
>- The door opens

>[!fail] Lightning
>- A _[[Thunder Elementals]]_ is summoned and is hostile to the player
>- The air becomes dark and charged. It is considered [[Exploration#Lightly Obscured|Lightly Obscured]].
>- At initiative 5, 10, 15, and 20 one lightning strikes will land on a random tile in the room, doing `dice: 8d6` lightning damage to anyone struck.
>- If the elemental is struck, it will gain `dice:8d6|noform` hp

### The Inner Sactum

Once the correct tile is activated, the stone slabs barring entrance to the inner sanctum slowly moves to the side revealing an inner chamber. This inner chamber is notable different than the previous cavern, made up of much more precise stonework. The plant life that had seeped into the previous cavern has not penetrated the sealed entrance. This room is a place of worship, with a grand statue of [[Talos]] standing and looking towards the entrance of the room. Seated in front of this statue are three more corpses. In stark contrast to the grotesque positions the corpses in the previous room bore, these forms almost seem to be in a sort of meditative position. All of these corpses have various individualized Oracle Relics on their person.

- [[Zephyr Kaelith]] - A tiefling corpse seated directly in front of the statue of Talos. Wearing a [[Shellguard Armor]] decorated with the symbol of Talos on the breastplate. Next to his peaceful body is a scrap of parchment.
	- Zephyr’s Oracle Relics are stored in an intricately carved driftwood box: *smoothed driftwood splinters, barnacle encrusted beads, sea-salt crystals, shark teeth.*
- [[Juno Dorneth]] - A halfling corpse. Dressed in more simple leather gear and wearing [[Mistwalker’s Armor]].
	- Juno’s Oracle Relics are stored in a glass jar: *braided dried kelp, spiral shells, glass beads, coral fragments.*
- [[Myr Otharion]] - A human corpse. Wearing similar leather gear, with a shield on his back. [[Animated Shield]]
	- Myr’s Oracle Relics are all strung into a necklace: *smoothed river rocks, small pieces of iron scrap, several sea-bird feathers, small fish bones.*

Time has causes most of the scrolls and literature in the room to be lost, but the stone carvings on the wall are still legible. There are depictions of wardens finding and selecting their oracle relics and choosing how to store them.
