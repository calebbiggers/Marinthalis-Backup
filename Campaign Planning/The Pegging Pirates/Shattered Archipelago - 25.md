## Recap

>[!reading]
>Last we left off, after surviving the assault on the village of Kletva, the town leader Vargen took you all aside and revealed the tragic truth of his past—how Shirina, a pale elven woman of immense power, emerged from a portal deep in the forest, slaughtered his family, and unleashed the shadow plague upon the island. Determined to end her reign, he sought the crew’s help, offering 200 gold, trinkets, and anything else the town could offer.
>
>After accepting this offer, you all journeyed through the forest, eventually reaching Vargen’s ancestral land. There, seated on a throne of shadows in front of the Shadowfell portal, Shirina declared herself the island’s ruler. Chaos erupted as Vargen transformed into a beast and attacked. Shadows poured through the portal, but you all fought fiercely, destroying the crystals keeping it open. Together with Vargen, you defeated Shirina and the massive shadow beast she summoned, ending her dark grip on the island of Stygia.

## Scenes

### The Next Morning

The players will all wake up the next morning on the [[Midwinter|Midwinter’s Day]].

>[!quote]
>The gentle creak of wood and the soft lapping of waves against the hull are the first sounds to greet you when you all wake. As each of you slowly wake up and make way to splintered main deck, the oppressive chill of the shadow plague is gone, replaced by a soothing breeze.
>
>You hear the calls of Seabirds gliding lazily in the sky. The waters shimmer in the morning sun, no longer darkened by an unnatural dull shadows.

### Returning to Town

>[!quote] Upon Entry
>_As you all enter the familiar town of [[Kletva]], the crisp morning air seems to have taken on a new life. No longer under the influence of [[The Shadowfell]], color and vibrancy has returned. Members of the town have begun to return to their shops, fields, & homes. Making your way through the cobbled streets you see [[Zorin Kornek|Zorin]], the half-orc cook, going through the remains of what looks like a burnt out shop. Closer to the church, you see [[Aethelflaed Seerclaw|Aethel]] who seems to be restringing a canvas roof on a small treehouse—the previously dead looking branches already budding._

>[!quote] Upon reaching the church fortifications
>_ Arriving at the front gate of the wooden fortifications, you can see that the pit trap in front of the door has been recently filled in, but you can still recognized the scars of battle on the ground and the shoddily put together walls._

>[!quote] After reaching the church fortification
>_All of a sudden, you hear a male voice yell out “Look out below!”. Those of you closest to the door quickly jump back as the entire front section of the wall comes crashing down. As the dust clears, you see the burly figure of [[Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] who looks to be working with several townsfolk to tear down the protective wall around the church of Selûne. As soon as he sees you through the smoke, you can see his face turn to a smile as he greets you._

- Vargen will offer the crew the promised contents of the small chest he had, 200 GP and various knick-knacks. If pressed, he will also offer [[Vargen’s Greataxe|his father’s greataxe]], several crates of Stygian obsidian but will ask for the parties discretion about his affliction.
- If asked about celebrating, Vargen will say that even though the town is free from the showdown-plague, it will take weeks before there is enough food for a celebration. And the town has no alcohol as there has been no trade, and the only master distiller in town was one of the first casualties years ago.

### Celebrating

- If the crew gives some of their alcohol to the town for the party, a celebration will happen that night.

>[!info] Random NPCs

> - **Vin Aelthor** - elven man. Was a farmer.

### Leaving the Island

### Encountering a Castaway

The crew will encounter a small island.
>[!quote]
>As your ship drifts closer to the tiny island, the sound of waves gently lapping against the sandy shore fills the air. The beach is unremarkable at first crescent of pale sand bordered by scattered driftwood and a few jagged rocks. Yet, near the water’s edge, a figure lies motionless, half-buried in the sand as if the tide had only just deposited them there.

### Storm Warden Temple

Upon noticing the jutting stone.

>[!quote]
>You notice a peculiar formation of what looks like tooled stone jutting out of the sand. Looking closer, it has been weathered by the salty air and overgrown with creeping vines. Barely noticeable, the stone bears faint carvings of storm clouds and lightning bolts.

Upon getting closer to inspect.

>[!quote]
>As you draw closer, you discover a narrow staircase carved into the rock, descending into the earth. The entrance is partially obscured by tangled roots and debris, as though the island itself seeks to guard its secrets. Beyond the threshold, the air grows damp and cool, the faint smell of brine and decay lingering. at the base of the stairs, you find yourself in an a hollowed cavern of carved stone, the walls adorned with faded murals of storm-wielding figures navigating treacherous seas. A sense of abandonment pervades the space, broken only by the occasional drip of water from above.

>[!quote]
>As your eyes adjust to the light, you see, scattered among the crumbled remnants of stone lie several corpses, their skeletal remains twisted in grotesque final poses. Many clutch rusted cutlasses or splintered pistols, their weapons long rendered useless by time and salt air. Torn and faded scraps of clothing still cling to their bones.

### Four Storms Riddle
