# Shattered Archipelago - 30

## To Do

## Scenes

## Post Mortem

- My players (A pirate crew) had just docked their ship in an isolated cove off the coast of Siroccia. Hiding there in order to evade the increased islguard oversight
- The plan was to leave the ship in the cove, and travel over foot by land to the town of seaglass, only 50 miles or so away.
- They noticed that this cove wasn't actually abandoned and it looked like someone fished there
- Upon climbing the well-worn path up, they found a home built into a barrelbark tree. In this tree they found an odd old gnome hermit who lived there
- The gnome (named soleit) warned them that travelling by foot over the splitroot highlands in such a small group was dangerous as Roc's patrolled the sky looking for vulnerable prey to pick off
- He offered to guide them to seaglass himself and the crew accepted.
- He guided them through their trek.
- About halfway through the trip, once making camp in a fallen rotted out barrelbark tree, the players noticed some glowing red lights in the distance.
- Otherwise uneventful, the night passed. Then next day the crew was attacked by two invisible flame-like creatures. These creatures were almost completely invisible and difficult to combat, until Gnar's axe he got from Vargen seemed to disrupt their abilities.
- Using this to their advantage and with the help of their new ally soleit, the crew defeated the creatures.
