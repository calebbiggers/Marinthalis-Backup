## Recap

>[!reading]
>Last session, after deciding to grant passage to your newfound ally, Kael, you all took the night to rest on the island. Around a roaring bonfire, Gnar and Kael engaged in a drinking competition, with Gnar emerging victorious after downing an impressive 19 drinks. Meanwhile, Keiran took the opportunity to study both Poe and Teegs.
>
>The next morning, you set sail once more. The following days at sea were largely uneventful, aside from a brief but mesmerizing encounter with a pod of glimmer whales. However, things took a turn when you came upon a naval battle between an Isleguard vessel and a pirate ship. From a distance, you lent your aid—Poe unleashing a breath of fire and Gnar letting loose a thunderous roar—tipping the scales in favor of the pirates. With the Isleguard captain surrendering, the battle was won.
>
>In gratitude for your help, the pirate captain, Isaac Riddick, shared troubling news. The Isleguard forces near Siroccia had intensified their crackdown on piracy, forcing his crew to abandon the Tempest. Even more concerning, as part of this effort, several notorious outlaws were slated for public execution in the port town of Seaglass—including Captain Storm of Ferocity, the brother of Lock.
