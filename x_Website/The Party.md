## Current Members

### Gnar Rosewater

![[gnar_image.png|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Gnar is a stoutly built [[Halfling]] [[Barbarian]] ([[Path of the Storm Herald]]) with pale skin, brown hair, and sharp brown eyes. Standing at 3'6", he wears a magical eyepatch over his injured eye, which features an embroidered dragon’s eye that moves as if alive. Scrappy, quick-tempered, and impulsive, Gnar is fiercely loyal to his friends, family, and crewmates. Though happy-spirited and flirty after a few drinks, he is deeply afraid of losing those he loves and struggles to form deeper romantic relationships.

Gnar grew up in the coastal village of [[The World of Marinthalis#Isaola|Isaola]], where he learned the family fishing trade. His life was forever changed when [[Groups & Organizations#The Whisper Pirates|The Whisper Pirates]] led by [[NPCs#Edina Drakkar|Edina Drakkar]] attacked his village, killing his father and capturing his family. Losing his eye in an attempt to save them, Gnar escaped by hiding in a wine barrel. Later, he joined Captain [[NPCs#Grommet Payne|Grommet Payne's]] pirate crew, learning to survive on the seas. Haunted by dreams of his mother and driven by a desire for revenge, Gnar is determined to find his family and bring justice to those who wronged him.

### Keiran Thalassa

As the youngest of the Thalassa family, Keiran grew up in [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate]], surrounded by powerful sorcerers, including her mother and three older brothers. Her mother claimed Keiran's father was a Marid, a water genie she met after her first husband's death, making Keiran a water genasi. Lacking the magical gifts of her siblings, Keiran turned to invention and mechanics, learning from a family friend, [[NPCs#Otto Higgins|Otto]], who became a father figure. Now, Keiran seeks to uncover her mysterious heritage while forging her own path.

As the eldest Thalassa sibling, Quinn naturally stepped into the role of “man of the house” after their father’s death. His mastery of storm magic earned him respect in [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate]], but the weight of his responsibilities often leaves him feeling burdened.
