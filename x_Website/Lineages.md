# Lineages

![[lineages-banner.jpg|banner]]

The world of [[The World of Marinthalis|Marinthalis]] is vast and diverse with creatures of all shapes and sizes. In our campaign, the species or race of a creature will be referred to as its _Lineage_. There are countless different lineages scattered throughout the world and it’s various planes. I’ve compiled some known ones here:

## Common Lineages

These lineages are found throughout Marinthalis in abundance and make up most of the general population.
- [[Human]]
- [[Gnome]]
- [[Halfling]]
- [[Elf]]
- [[Goliath]]
- [[Dwarf]]
- [[Orc]]
- [[Triton]]
- [[Goblinoids]]

## Uncommon Lineages

These lineages are generally less common around Marinthalis. Each lineage may have locations where they congregate and are more common, but generally they are a rare sight. A given person who does not travel may have seen only a handful of them in their lifetime. Those who venture out to explore the world have seen a greater number, but they are nonetheless less common.

These lineages are the stuff of stories and legend. While a given person may gave heard whispers or rumors of someone of these lineages, they more than likely have never met one—At least knowingly.

## Others

Marinthalis is an expansive and mysterious world with its seemingly endless ocean and countless islands. While many lineages are known, the depths of its uncharted regions leave room for countless others yet to be discovered. If a lineage isn’t listed, feel free to request it so we can weave its story into the fabric of the world.
