# The World of Marinthalis

![[Island-Banner-2.png|banner]]

## Overview

 Marinthalis is a world shaped by its vast ocean, where sprawling waters stretch as far as the eye can see, dotted by countless islands. Each island holds its own secrets—some are thriving hubs of trade and culture, while others are dangerous, forgotten places filled with ancient ruins and mysterious creatures.

The people of Marinthalis live their lives on the seas, navigating between islands as merchants, explorers, and pirates. These waters are both a source of life and a battleground for those seeking wealth, power, and adventure. From bustling port towns to hidden coves, every island tells a different story, waiting to be discovered by those brave enough to sail its shores.

## World Features

### A Vast Ocean

The ocean of Marinthalis is a vast, ever-changing expanse that covers the world. It is both the lifeblood and the greatest danger to those who sail its waters. The ocean is as unpredictable as it is beautiful, with calm, sunlit waters giving way to violent storms in an instant. For the people of Marinthalis, the ocean is not just a means of travel and trade, but a force to be respected and feared.

### The Wild Tempest

![[Tempest-Banner.jpg|border]]
The Wild Tempest, a vast magical storm that has dominated Marinthalis for nearly 1,500 years, remains one of the world’s greatest mysteries. The year itself is now measured from the storm’s appearance, with the current year being 1492 PT (Post Tempest). Though not entirely unexplored, the tempest’s swirling winds, chaotic seas, and unpredictable magic make navigation a near-impossible challenge.

Despite the dangers, rumors of ancient secrets, lost treasures, and hidden islands within the storm continue to lure adventurers into its depths. However, few return unscathed, as the storm’s ever-shifting nature keeps its mysteries hidden, constantly testing those daring enough to sail into its heart.

### The Two Statues

![[#The Entrance to the Wild Tempest]]

### The Midtempest Boundary

At the storm’s heart lies the Midtempest Boundary, an impenetrable wall of dense fog and violent storm that no ship has been able to pass.This boundary marks the line between the known and the truly unknown, preventing explorers from reaching the center of the tempest. What lies beyond remains the subject of legend and speculation, as the secrets of the storm’s heart continue to elude even the bravest sailors.

## Government

Being a world made up of scattered islands, the forms of government of the various islands are as diverse as the islands themselves. However, there is a coalition formed made up of many islands.

## Islands & Locations

The world of Marinthalis is vast, with countless islands scattered across its endless sea. Each island, whether large or small, holds its own unique culture, resources, and dangers. Some are bustling trade hubs, while others are isolated and mysterious, home to ancient ruins or hidden secrets. The islands listed below are of particular relevance to our campaign.

---

### Stormgate Isle

Once known by a name long lost to history, Stormgate Isle now serves as the gateway to [[#The Wild Tempest]]. The only Council-sanctioned entrance to the tempest lies just off its shores, giving the island its current name. After the tempest’s appearance, [[Groups & Organizations#The Council of Isles|The Council of Isles]] swiftly took control of the island, transforming it into a critical hub for exploration and regulation of the storm. Today, the entire island is covered by the sprawling city of Baldur’s Gate, a bustling port and the last stop before venturing into the Wild Tempest.

#### The City of Baldur's Gate

![[baldurs-gate-banner.webp|border]]
Baldur’s Gate is one of the three capital cities in Marinthalis and a key seat of political and economic power for the Council of Isles. Positioned at the entrance to the Wild Tempest, it is a major hub for trade, exploration, and adventuring. The city is divided into two distinct areas: the Lower City, where trade and maritime activity flourish, and the Upper City, where wealth and governance reside.

##### Baldur's Gate Map

##### The Lower City

![[lower-city.png]]
The Lower City of Baldur’s Gate is a dense, fog-covered district teeming with life and activity. With its proximity to The Grey Harbor, the Lower City is a hub of trade, drawing merchants, sailors, and adventurers from across Marinthalis. However, the reduced presence of the Isleguard compared to the Upper City makes it a hotbed for crime and smuggling, where shadowy deals and illicit activities thrive in the narrow, winding streets. The Lower City is a place of opportunity and danger, where the line between fortune and ruin is razor-thin.

###### The Grey Harbor

![[grey-harbor-at-night.webp|float-right|relative|wmed|border]]The Grey Harbor is the lifeblood of Baldur’s Gate, where ships from across Marinthalis dock in a haze of mist and salt. True to its name, the harbor is often shrouded in a thick fog that rolls in from the sea, giving it an eerie, ethereal atmosphere. The docks are always bustling with activity—sailors unloading goods, merchants haggling over prices, and adventurers preparing for journeys into the Wild Tempest. Despite the chaos, the Lower City is essential to the economic flow of Baldur’s Gate, bustling with energy, opportunity, and risk.

###### Sturgeon Lane

A street within [[#The Lower City]]. One of the smaller and less crowded docks within the port is located on this street.

###### The Blushing Mermaid

A famous tavern and inn located in [[#The Lower City]]. Known for its lively atmosphere, it serves as a popular gathering spot for locals and travelers alike. The tavern is a hub of activity, where sailors, merchants, and adventurers come together to share stories and enjoy the vibrant nightlife of the city. Despite its bustling environment, The Blushing Mermaid also offers a degree of seclusion for those seeking a more private setting, making it a versatile venue for both social gatherings and discreet meetings.

###### Ink & Arcana

A tattoo parlor in [[#The Lower City]] run by [[NPCs#Melnir Swiftcarver|Melnir Swiftcarver]]. This shop, nestled in a bustling corner of Baldur's Gate, is a sanctuary of creativity and self-expression. Adorned with tapestries of exotic designs and sketches of intricate patterns, it welcomes all who seek to etch their memories and aspirations onto their skin.

###### Master Elrikor's Tower

One of two wizard towers in [[#The Lower City]], this tall tower is both the home and research facility of [[NPCs#Master Elrikor Galanodel|Master Elrikor Galanodel]]. A slender, multi-story structure made of dark stone, the tower has a foreboding appearance against the skyline of Baldur's Gate. The tower features narrow, arched windows, allowing Elrikor to observe the city below while maintaining an air of secrecy.

###### Greyward Wall

Greyward Wall a great wall that divides the Upper and Lower City of Baldur’s Gate. Named for the ever-present fog that blankets the Lower City, the Greyward Wall marks a clear divide between the bustling, mist-shrouded streets near The Grey Harbor and the clearer, more refined Upper City at a higher elevation. Rising high above the docks and harbor, the wall symbolizes both a physical and social separation in the city. Connected to the Greyward is the imposing Isleguard Keep, the headquarters of the Isleguard force, where the city’s defenders oversee the protection of Baldur’s Gate and the surrounding seas.

###### The Heap

An older district of the lower city, the Heap has fallen into decay. The area is currently made up of a mix of ruins and slums. Characterized by its dilapidated buildings and neglected infrastructure, the area is filled with narrow, winding streets, crumbling structures, and makeshift encampments.

###### Basilisk Gate

###### The Agotada Mines

Next to [[#The Heap]], these old mines have long been depleted and abandoned. The mines are left over from the early days of the [[Groups & Organizations#The Council of Isles|The Council of Isles]] acquisition and transformation of the island into the sprawling metropolis it is now. Once bustling with activity, the Agotada Mines have been left to fall to disarray, leaving behind a twisting network of tunnels and caverns that run beneath the entirety of [[#Stormgate Isle]].

##### The Upper City

The Upper City is home to the wealthiest citizens of Baldur’s Gate, including powerful merchants, politicians, and members of the Council of Isles. The streets are clean, orderly, and free of the chaos that defines the Lower City. As the center of governance and wealth, the Upper City is where decisions are made that shape not only Baldur’s Gate but also the broader world of Marinthalis.

###### Isleguard Keep

A large fortress connected to the [[#Greyward Wall]], it acts as the headquarters of [[Groups & Organizations#The Isleguard|Isleguard]]. The keep has an entrance in [[#The Lower City]], but it itself is mostly contained within [[#The Upper City]]. The keep contains barracks and training areas in addition to the main fortress itself.

###### The Wide

![[the-wide.jpg|border]]
In the heart of the Upper City lies The Wide, a vast open market where anything imaginable can be found. From exotic goods to rare magical items, the market is filled with traders offering a variety of wares. The Wide is a central point of commerce, and one of the most famous markets in all of Marinthalis.

###### Enchanted Elegance

Known for its exquisite taste and attention to detail, the boutique provides a shopping experience that combines luxury with a touch of magic. It is a favored destination for those seeking to make a statement at social gatherings or formal events, ensuring that its patrons are always dressed in the latest styles.

###### Manorborne

![[manorborne.jpg|float-right|relative|wmed|border]]The district of Manorborne is the wealthiest part of the Upper City, home to Baldur’s Gate’s most affluent citizens. Here, royalty, high-level officials, and the richest merchants of the city reside in grand estates. Manorborne is a symbol of the city’s prosperity and power, representing the political and social elite who shape the future of Baldur’s Gate and beyond.

#### The Entrance to the Wild Tempest

Off the coast of Stormgate Isle, the entrance to the Wild Tempest stands as a testament to both power and mystery. Built with the support of the Council of Isles, the entrance is marked by two colossal statues rising from the ocean, their stone forms weathered by centuries of turbulent seas and storms. The two beings depicted in the statures are [[Valkur]] and [[NPCs#Christof Blacktide|Christof Blacktide]]. Between these two towering figures lies the only safe passage into the tempest—a narrow, carefully charted route that offers a slim chance of survival for those brave enough to venture into the storm’s depths. The path is tightly regulated by the Council, and only the most daring or desperate attempt the journey.

---

### Siroccia

Siroccia is a large island country located deep within the heart of [[#The Wild Tempest]]. Its arid climate and rugged terrain make it a harsh and unforgiving place to live, yet its strategic location along a trade route charted by [[#The Council of Isles]] gives it immense importance. Siroccia stands as a bastion of resilience, its people thriving despite the tempestuous storms that constantly batter the surrounding seas. Traders and adventurers brave the tempest to reach Siroccia, drawn by its valuable resources and the opportunities that arise from its central position within the Wild Tempest.

#### The City of Neverwinter

![[neverwinter.jpg|border]]
At the heart of Siroccia lies its capital, Neverwinter, a city known for its stark contrast to the desolate lands surrounding it. Neverwinter is a bustling hub of trade and commerce, protected by towering walls and advanced defenses built to withstand the relentless desert. Despite its harsh surroundings, the city is a beacon of life in the Wild Tempest, attracting merchants, explorers, and sailors from across Marinthalis. Neverwinter’s markets teem with rare goods from the tempest's trade routes, making it a vital point of connection between the island and the outside world.

---

### Waterdeep

![[waterdeep-city-image.webp|border]]
Like [[#Siroccia]], Waterdeep is located within [[#The Wild Tempest]]. However, this island is unique. It is less of an island and more of a city, lying deep beneath the sea on the ocean floor directly beneath one edge of [[#The Midtempest Boundary]]. The city thrives on the trade between explorers venturing further into the storm, sailors travelling to sell their wares, and those who dwell beneath the waves. Additionally, there is a large tourism industry, with many from all over Marinthalis willing to risk travelling within the tempest in order to witness the city's spectacle.

Originally a [[Elf#Sea Elves|Sea Elf]] town, through the exploration of the Tempest, the small village quickly grew to the expansive underwater metropolis it is today. There is still a large Aquafolk population, with Sea Elves being the majority. Nowadays, in order to accommodate those who cannot breath underwater, sections of the city are encompassed by large air bubbles, allowing those of land-based lineage to survive on the sea floor.

---

### Dragon Turtle’s Rest

Dragon Turtle’s Rest is a tropical island known for its two massive and ancient dragon-turtle skeletons that dominate the landscape. These towering remnants are visible across the island, serving as both a landmark and a reminder of the island’s mysterious past. Unlike most islands in Marinthalis, Dragon Turtle’s Rest has refused to join [[Groups & Organizations#The Council of Isles|The Council of Isles]], leaving it without the protection of [[Groups & Organizations#The Isleguard|The Isleguard]]. As a result, the island has become a refuge for pirates, smugglers, and other criminals seeking to escape the reach of the law. Its dense jungles and treacherous terrain offer plenty of hiding places for those who wish to remain unseen, making the island a dangerous but alluring destination.

#### Canalla

![[canalla.png|border]]
On the coast of Dragon Turtle’s Rest lies Canalla, the island’s only large settlement. A lawless and bustling city, Canalla thrives on the trade of illegal goods, stolen treasures, and pirate dealings. The streets are packed with sailors, pirates, and merchants, all looking to make a fortune away from the prying eyes of the Council. Though lacking the stability of cities protected by the Isleguard, Canalla has its own unspoken rules and alliances that keep the chaotic port functioning. It’s a place of opportunity for those willing to take risks, but also a city where betrayal and violence are never far away.

##### The Cracked Mug

![[cracked-mug-banner.jpg|border]]
The Cracked Mug presents itself as a quaint and unassuming tavern nestled within the cobbled streets of [[#Canalla]]. Its exterior, with worn bricks and a flickering lantern by the entrance, suggests a simple alehouse where patrons can enjoy a drink by the fire. However, beneath this modest façade lies the tavern's true allure—a hidden fight arena in the basement.

Owned by [[NPCs#Grizzlewort Oakenshank|Grizzlewort Oakenshank]], affectionately known as Grizz, the tavern cleverly conceals its dual nature. While the main floor offers rustic charm and the comforting scent of aged spirits, the basement transforms into a vibrant hub of underground pugilism. Here, the clinking of tankards above is mirrored by the clash of fists below, as patrons seek both liquid courage and the thrill of combat. Grizz, with his background in both brewing and brawling, has masterfully integrated these worlds, creating an establishment where camaraderie and clandestine contests coexist under one roof.

##### Laina’s Herbal Remedies

One of the few places of healing in the city of [[#Canalla]], this quaint shop is run by [[NPCs#Laina Pebblegrace|Laina Pebblegrace]], an elderly [[Gnome]] woman.  The shop exudes a warm and welcoming atmosphere. The exterior of the shop is adorned with hanging baskets of vibrant herbs, flowers and other greenery.

The shop is well-organized, with sections dedicated to different types of remedies, from healing salves and potions of sleep to rare plants. Soft, ambient lighting and the gentle sound of wind chimes create a serene environment, making it a favored spot for those in need of herbal solutions or simply a moment of tranquility amidst the bustling city.

##### Maiden in the Flask

The Maiden in the Flask is a classy speakeasy located in the city of [[#Canalla]]. It exudes an air of sophistication and exclusivity, attracting patrons who appreciate a refined drinking experience. The exterior of the establishment is discreet, with a simple sign bearing its name. Upon entering, guests are greeted by a dimly lit, intimate setting. The interior is adorned with polished wooden furnishings and plush seating, creating a cozy yet upscale atmosphere.

##### The Salty Straw

The Salty Straw is a lively and welcoming gay bar in [[#Canalla]]. It has a reputation for being vibrant space frequented by patrons from all walks of life. Hosting some form of entertainment almost nightly, the bar is seldom empty. It also offers a wide selection of drinks, including creative cocktails and local brews, catering to a diverse clientele.

##### Abandoned Fishery

![[abandoned-warehouse-2.jpg|border]]
A dilapidated and forgotten structure, the exterior of the fishery is weathered and worn, with peeling paint and broken windows that hint at its former life as a thriving hub for local fishermen. The building is surrounded by overgrown vegetation, with weeds and wildflowers reclaiming the space around it. The air is filled with the faint, lingering scent of salt and fish. The building has its own dock within, presumably for deliveries of fish in the past.

The fishery has become a hideout for the [[Groups & Organizations#Displacer Beast Gang|The Displacer Beast Gang]], who have taken advantage of its secluded location. When the crew first arrived, they discovered a chained displacer beast, [[NPCs#Umwin Hickleseed|Umwin's]] pet, who served as a guard.

### Razor Reef

![[razor-reef-banner.jpg|border]]

Near the island of [[The World of Marinthalis#Dragon Turtle’s Rest|Dragon Turtle's Rest]] lies Razor Reef. The reef is a treacherous and expansive area of ocean characterized by jagged rocks that protrude menacingly from the water's surface. This perilous region is notorious among sailors for its ability to ensnare and wreck ships that venture too close. The sharp rocks are often hidden just beneath the waves, making navigation through the reef particularly hazardous. The surrounding waters are turbulent, with strong currents and swirling eddies that can easily catch an unwary vessel off guard.

Because the reef acts as a ship graveyard, the area is also frequently visited by fearless scavengers. These brave souls navigate the dangerous area and dive, searching for any treasure lost to the rocks. Those scavengers who make it back often return with the treasure they were seeking.

The crew ventured into the reef to investigate the disappearance of ***[[Vessels & Vehicles#The Emperor of Waves|The Emperor of Waves]]***. a trade ship owned by [[NPCs#Aubreck Drallion|Aubreck Drallion]]. He hired them to find and retrieve an iron chest that was among the ship’s cargo. After finding the ship scuttled on a rock protruding out of the sea, the crew combatted a cultist who had taken over the ship. After dealing with him, a giant octopus attacked and sank _The Emperor of Waves_.

### Tranquil Refuge Archipelago

![[Tranquil-refuge.jpg|border]]
The Tranquil Refuge Archipelago is a remote and serene chain of islands in Marinthalis, named for its isolation from the major trade routes that crisscross the world’s oceans. With minimal sea traffic, the archipelago is a peaceful retreat, untouched by the bustling commerce that defines many other islands. Its quiet waters and lush landscapes offer a stark contrast to the more chaotic regions of Marinthalis, making it a haven for those seeking solitude or respite from the demands of the outside world.

#### Lampool

Lampool is a small, marshy island nestled within the Tranquil Refuge Archipelago. Known for its peaceful seclusion, Lampool thrives on its rich fishing industry, with the coastal town of Saltmarsh serving as its main settlement. The island is dotted with swamps and wetlands, creating a unique landscape that sets it apart from other islands in Marinthalis. Although a member of the Council of Isles, Lampool operates with relative independence due to its remote location and minimal Isleguard presence. The island’s economy revolves around fishing, trade, and a burgeoning mining industry, while smuggling remains a profitable venture for many. Despite its quiet appearance, Lampool is a hub of activity and a vital part of the archipelago.

##### The Town of Saltmarsh

![[Saltmarsh.png|float-right|relative|wmed|border]]Saltmarsh is a small coastal town on the island of Lampool, deeply rooted in its fishing industry. The town may be encrusted in sea salt and carry the scent of rotting fish, but it has long prospered from its rich fishing grounds. In recent years, a dwarven mining operation near the town has sparked hopes of new wealth, though it has also brought tension, especially among the fishing community. Additionally, smuggling has become a lucrative business, with many locals viewing it as a victimless crime. Saltmarsh is a town where opportunity and danger coexist, making it a bustling yet unpredictable place on the edge of civilization.

###### Saltmarsh Map

![[saltmarsh-players.png|border]]

###### The Snapping Line

This popular inn and tavern is built from the planks and hulls of half a dozen decommissioned fishing ships. Its décor is predictably nautical in theme, and its sleeping rooms are plain but comfortable renditions of a ship’s cabins. The smell of fish has never been scrubbed from its walls, and those who stay the night find their belongings steeped in the scent, which lasts for several days. Sailors and fishers gather here to trade stories and drink into the night.

The Snapping Line is run by a young woman named [[NPCs#Hanna Rist|Hanna Rist]], who comes from a family of well-known lobster catchers, as well as her wife [[NPCs#Arda Seaborne|Arda Seaborne]]. The Rist family also makes a spirit from lobster meat and potatoes called claw wine; it is, to put it mildly, an acquired taste. Hanna employs several former dockhands to keep peace in her bar.

###### The Leap

The Leap is an outcropping of rock nearly a hundred feet above the churning water of the coast of Lampool. Several stone benches stand near this precipitous edge, and a few stone markers sit in the tall grass nearby.

Traditionally, the people of Saltmarsh leap from the cliffs into the water below when a loved one drowns at sea. The jump is usually not fatal; the water below the Leap is free of rocks, and it is a short swim back to dry land.

###### Winston’s General Store

Winston's General Store is a small yet popular building located in the eastern part of Saltmarsh. Run by [[NPCs#Winston Richett|Winston Richett]], the store offers a wide array of general goods, catering to the everyday needs of adventurers and townsfolk alike. Its shelves are stocked with common items, from basic provisions to essential adventuring gear, creating an inviting atmosphere for all who enter.

However, beneath its unassuming exterior, Winston's store harbors a clandestine operation. Secretly aligned with [[Groups & Organizations#The Tide Syndicate|The Tide Syndicate]], Winston discreetly moves their illicit goods through his establishment. The store's innocuous appearance serves as the perfect cover for the smuggling activities, allowing Winston to conduct business with those in the know while maintaining the façade of a simple merchant.

##### The Abandoned Home

![[haunted_house.png|float-right|relative|wmed|border]]This old home, long abandoned, sits in eerie solitude atop the cliffs, four miles up the coast from [[The World of Marinthalis#The Town of Saltmarsh|Saltmarsh]]. The once-grand house, now a shadow of its former self, is surrounded by a crumbling stone wall that has collapsed in several places, leaving gaps that expose the overgrown interior grounds. At the end of the old, winding road leading to the house, an ornate iron gate, now rusted and weathered, sways gently in the wind, its creaking sound carried on the breeze.

The players discovered a smuggling operation running out of a secret dock in a cave below the home. From this secret dock, [[Groups & Organizations#The Tide Syndicate|The Tide Syndicate]] was running a smuggling operation.

---

### Isaola

The home island of [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]], Isaola is a small island Northeast of the [[#Tranquil Refuge Archipelago]]. It is a small island mostly home to [[Halfling]] fishing villages. Unlike many halfling communities known for their peaceful nature, Isaola's inhabitants are known to fiercely defend their villages against raiders and pirates. The community places a high value on family and friendships, and they have a deep appreciation for good seafood and ale. The island's culture is shaped by its resilience and strong sense of community, making it a unique and vibrant place within the archipelago.

---

### Stygia

Stygia is a small volcanic island located within [[#The Wild Tempest]]. The island is characterized by its dense forests, fertile farmlands, and a towering black mountain at its center. Historically, Stygia was known for exporting obsidian mined from the island. However, the island has been plagued by a mysterious shadow-plague that emerged around six years ago, drastically altering life on Stygia. The once-thriving community now struggles to survive amidst the devastation caused by this affliction.

#### The Refuge of Kletva

A small and mostly-destroyed town acting as a place of refuge for the remaining inhabitants of Stygia. The town is the only settlement on the island. Mostly in ruins, the survivors have built up a tall wooden barricade encompassing a hill where the town chapel is in order to protect them from the shadow-plague affecting the island.

---

### Drakefang Island

A mysterious island rumored to be near [[#Siroccia]]. According to [[NPCs#Borgos Leon|a captured whisper pirate]], the island is the base of operations of [[NPCs#Edina Drakkar|Edina Drakkar]].

- - -

### A Small Remote Island

![[small-island-banner.jpg|border]]
Following [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]]’s [[Wayfinding Oracle Relics]], the crew stumbled upon a tiny beach island, no larger than a market square. On the island they discovered a mysterious boulder with a staircase leading below ground carved into it.

#### A Mysterious Temple

![[overgrown-temple-banner.jpg|border]]
