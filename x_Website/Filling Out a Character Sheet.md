# Filling Out a Character Sheet

## 1. Choose a Character Sheet

You’ll need a physical character sheet to fill out all of your info in. The most common of which is the official D&D character sheet you can find [here](https://media.dndbeyond.com/compendium-images/phb/downloads/DnD_2024_Character-Sheet.pdf).

## 2. Choose a Name, Class, & Subclass

Choose a class, and write it on your character sheet. The table below summarizes the classes and includes links to each classes page.

### Class Overview

|     Class     |    Likes...    |    Primary Ability    | Complexity |
|:-------------:|:--------------:|:---------------------:|:----------:|
| [[Artificer]] |   Tinkering    |     Intelligence      |    High    |
| [[Barbarian]] |     Battle     |       Strength        |  Average   |
|   [[Bard]]    |   Performing   |       Charisma        |    High    |
|  [[Cleric]]   |      Gods      |        Wisdom         |  Average   |
|   [[Druid]]   |     Nature     |        Wisdom         |    High    |
|  [[Fighter]]  |    Weapons     | Strength or Dexterity |    Low     |
|   [[Monk]]    | Unarmed combat | Dexterity and Wisdom  |    High    |
|  [[Paladin]]  |    Defense     | Strength and Charisma |  Average   |
|  [[Ranger]]   |    Survival    | Dexterity and Wisdom  |  Average   |
|   [[Rogue]]   |    Stealth     |       Dexterity       |    Low     |
| [[Sorcerer]]  |     Power      |       Charisma        |    High    |
|  [[Warlock]]  |  Occult lore   |       Charisma        |    High    |
|  [[Wizard]]   |   Spellbooks   |     Intelligence      |  Average   |

### Write Your Level

Write you level on your character sheet. Your characters are currently level 7 and we level up with milestone leveling so I’ll let you know when your characters gain a level.

>[!example]
>I’m naming my character “Fisty McFistface”. They are a [[Monk]] ([[Warrior of the Open Hand]]) and they are level 7.
>
>![[class-example.jpg]]

### Note Your Armor, Weapons, & Tools Proficiencies

Your Class and Subclass might give you training with certain categories of armor. This is described on your classes ***Core Class Traits Table*** found on each class page. Note your armor training on your character sheet. Armor training with a kind of armor means you can wear that armor effectively, gaining defensive bonuses from it. The categories of armor are described [[Armor|here]].

Your Class and Subclass may also give you training with certain weapons. This is also described in your ***Core Class Traits Table***. Anyone can wield a weapon, but you must have proficiency with it to add your Proficiency Bonus to an attack roll you make with it. A player character’s features can provide weapon proficiencies. The types of weapons are described [[Weapons|here]].

Additionally, your Class and Subclass might give you proficiency with one or more tools. If you have proficiency with a tool, add your Proficiency Bonus to any ability check you make that uses the tool. The types of tools and what they can do are described [[Tools|here]].

>[!example]
>Monks have no armor proficiencies. As a Monk, Fisty is proficient in all [[Weapons#Simple Melee Weapons|Simple Melee Weapons]] weapons, all [[Weapons#Simple Ranged Weapons|Simple Ranged Weapons]] and Martial weapons with the [[Weapons#Light|Light]] Property. Lastly, for their one tool proficiency, I am choosing [[Tools#Calligrapher’s Supplies|Calligrapher’s Supplies]]. Their Subclass does not grant them any further proficiencies.

## 2. Determine Your Base Ability Scores

### Generate Your Scores

For our campaign, we use standard array. This means that you use the following six scores for your abilities: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8. You then assign them to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma, keeping in mind your class’s primary ability. For more info on what each ability is used for you may visit [[The Six Abilities]].

Additionally, you may consult the Standard Array by Class table for suggestions on where to assign scores for your character’s class. The table puts the highest scores in a class’s main abilities.

#### Standard Array by Class

|     Class     | Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Cha |
|:-------------:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| [[Barbarian]] | 15  | 13  | 14  | 10  | 12  |  8  |
|   [[Bard]]    |  8  | 14  | 12  | 13  | 10  | 15  |
|  [[Cleric]]   | 14  |  8  | 13  | 10  | 15  | 12  |
|   [[Druid]]   |  8  | 12  | 14  | 13  | 15  | 10  |
|  [[Fighter]]  | 15  | 14  | 13  |  8  | 10  | 12  |
|   [[Monk]]    | 12  | 15  | 13  | 10  | 14  |  8  |
|  [[Paladin]]  | 15  | 10  | 13  |  8  | 12  | 14  |
|  [[Ranger]]   | 12  | 15  | 13  |  8  | 14  | 10  |
|   [[Rogue]]   | 12  | 15  | 13  | 14  | 10  |  8  |
| [[Sorcerer]]  | 10  | 13  | 14  |  8  | 12  | 15  |
|  [[Warlock]]  |  8  | 14  | 13  | 12  | 10  | 15  |
|  [[Wizard]]   |  8  | 12  | 13  | 15  | 14  | 10  |

### Note Your Base Scores Somewhere

Write down which score is going where somewhere separately. We will revisit the scores in the next section.

>[!example]
>For Fisty, I’m going to use the recommended layout here:
>
>| Str | Dex | Con | Int | Wis | Cha |
>|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
>| 12  | 15  | 13  | 10  | 14  |  8  |

## 3. Determine Origin

Determining your character’s origin involves choosing a background, and lineage.

A character’s background represents the place and occupation that were most formative for the character. The combination of background and lineage provides fertile soil for your imagination as you ponder your character’s earliest days.

### Choose a Background

Choose your character’s background, and write it on your character sheet. You can choose any of the backgrounds detailed [[Character Origins#Background Descriptions|here]].

The background you choose influences your character’s ability scores. Your background lists three abilities; increase one of those scores by 2 and a different one by 1, or increase all three by 1. Note that none of these increases can raise a score above 20.

Now that you have a background, you can write the ability scores on your sheet.

>[!example]
>For Fisty, I am chose the [[Character Origins#Acolyte|Acolyte]] background which can effect Intelligence, Wisdom and Charisma. I am going to choose to increase Wisdom by 2 and Charisma by 1.
>
>![[class-example-4.jpg]]
>

### Choose Starting Equipment

If you are creating a completely new character, a combination of your Class and your Background will determine what equipment you start with. If you’re transferring an old character to a paper sheet, you can just view your D&D Beyond inventory to see what you have.

>[!example]
>From the [[Monk]] class, Fisty comes with:
> - 1 Spear
> - 5 Daggers
> - some [[Tools#Calligrapher’s Supplies|Calligrapher’s Supplies]]
> - an [[Adventuring Gear#Explorer’s Pack|Explorer’s Pack]]
> - 11 GP
>
>From the [[Character Origins#Acolyte|Acolyte]] Background, Fisty comes with:
> - more [[Tools#Calligrapher’s Supplies\|Calligrapher’s Supplies]]
> - a [[Adventuring Gear#Book\|Book]] (of prayers)
> - a [[Adventuring Gear#Holy Symbol\|Holy Symbol]]
> - some [[Adventuring Gear#Parchment\|Parchment]] (10 sheets)
> - a [[Adventuring Gear#Robe\|Robe]]
> - 8 GP
>
> These items can be listed on the character sheet in the “Equipment” portion of the sheet.
>
>![[class-example-5.jpg]]

### Choose a Lineage

Typically in D&D, you choose a species. For our campaign, I’m referring to these as “Lineages”. You may choose from any Lineage listed [[Lineages|here]], or you may suggest one of your own and we can build it together. Note your traits you gain from your Lineage.

Your character’s [[Combat#Creature Size|Size]] and [[Combat#Speed|Speed]] are determined by the character’s Lineage; record these in the appropriate places on your character sheet as well.

>[!example]
>I would like Fisty to be big and strong, so I am going to select the [[Goliath]] lineage.
>
>![[class-example-6.jpg]]
>
>Goliaths are a Medium sized creature, and have a speed of 35 feet.
>
>![[class-example-7.jpg]]
>
>As a Goliath, Fisty has the Stone’s Endurance, Large Form, and Powerful Build Traits.
>
>![[class-example-8.jpg]]

## 5. Add Your Free Feat

In order to further individualize your characters, when you hit level 4, in addition to your Ability Score Increase I let you guys each choose a Feat to add to your character. The Feats are listed [[Feats|here]]. Add the whatever ability scores and features it has to your character sheet.

## 6. Fill in Details

### Record Class Features

For your level 7 character, review both the Class page and the Subclass pages for your choices, and fill in the Features you have at level 7. You will have an Ability Score Adjustment level, so I would recommend updating your scores first before you move on to the rest of the features.

You can write all of these features in the Class Features section of your character sheet, but I could recommend coming up with your own way of noting these features that works for you. For some you could just modify existing attacks or abilities to reflect the updated feature, or for others you could write a little card describing what it does.

>[!example]
>At level 7, Fisty has the following features. I also describe how I personally would keep track of this ability, but anyone can come up with their own method.
>- [[Monk#Level 1 Martial Arts|Martial Arts]] - Monk Level 1
>	- This affects his weapons. I will update the Weapons & Damage section of the sheet.
>- [[Monk#Level 1 Unarmored Defense|Unarmored Defense]] - Monk Level 1
>	- This affects his AC. I will update the AC section
>- [[Monk#Level 2 Monk’s Focus|Monk’s Focus]] - Monk Level 2
>	- I will make a little card showing the amount of focus points I have and what I could spend them on.
>- [[Monk#Level 2 Unarmored Movement|Unarmored Movement]] - Monk Level 2
>	- This affects his speed. I will update the Speed section.
>- [[Monk#Level 2 Uncanny Metabolism|Uncanny Metabolism]] - Monk Level 2
>	- I will make a little card to remember this ability.
>- [[Monk#Level 3 Deflect Attacks|Deflect Atacks]] - Monk Level 3
>	- I will make a little card to remember this ability.3
>- [[Warrior of the Open Hand#Level 3 Open Hand Technique|Open Hand Technique]] - Open Hand Level 3
>	- I will add this feature to my “Monk’s Focus” card.
>- an [[Monk#Level 4 Ability Score Improvement|Ablitiy Score improvement]] - Monk Level 4
>	- I will update Fisty’s stats. I will increase Wisdom by 2, making his Wisdom 18.
>- [[Monk#Level 4 Slow Fall|Slow Fall]] - Monk Level 4
>	- I will make a little card to remember this ability.
>- [[Monk#Level 5 Extra Attack|Extra Attack]] - Monk Level 5
>	- I will note that I can attack twice in the Weapons & Damage section of the sheet.
>- [[Monk#Level 5 Stunning Strike|Stunning Strike]] - Monk Level 5
>	- I will add this to my “Monk’s Focus” card.
>- [[Monk#Level 6 Empowered Strikes|Empowered Strikes]] - Monk Level 6
>	- I will note in the Weapons & Damage section that I can choose the damage type of my attacks.
>- [[Warrior of the Open Hand#Level 6 Wholeness of Body|Wholeness of Body]] - Open Hand Level 6
>	- I will make a little card showing this ability and how many uses I have.
>- [[Monk#Level 7 Evasion|Evasion]] - Monk Level 7
>	- I will make a little card to help me remember this ability.

### Fill In Numbers

You can now calculate your various ability and save scores. Note these numbers on your character sheet in their proper place.

#### Ability Modifiers & Proficiency Bonus

Determine your ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. Write the modifier next to each of your scores.

Your Proficiency Bonus is determined by your class and level. The table on your Class page will list it.

##### Ability Scores and Modifiers

| Score | Modifier |
|:-----:|:--------:|
|   3   |    −4    |
|  4–5  |    −3    |
|  6–7  |    −2    |
|  8–9  |    −1    |
| 10–11 |    +0    |
| 12–13 |    +1    |
| 14–15 |    +2    |
| 16–17 |    +3    |
| 18–19 |    +4    |
|  20   |    +5    |

>[!example]
>With Fisty’s ability scores, I can determine his ability modifiers using the table above. Additionally, at level 7, a Monks proficiency bonus is +3.
>
>![[class-example-10.jpg]]

#### Saving Throws.

For the saving throws you have proficiency in, add your Proficiency Bonus to the appropriate ability modifier and note the total. Some players also like to note the modifier for saving throws they’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

>[!example]
>As a monk, Fisty is proficient in Strength and Dexterity Saving Throws, so I will mark the proficiency bubble add his proficiency bonus to these stats.
>
>![[class-example-11.jpg]]

#### Skills

The skills you are proficient in are selected when you select your Class and Subclass. Your Class and Subclass page will tell you what options you have. For skills you have proficiency in mark the small proficiency bubble and add your Proficiency Bonus to the ability modifier associated with that skill, and note the total. You might also wish to note the modifier for skills you’re not proficient in, which is just the relevant ability modifier.

>[!example]
> From the Monk class, I chose that Fisty be proficient in Athletics and Religion, so I will mark those bubbles. His Subclass does not grant any additional proficiencies. I can use the bubbles to calculate the skill scores.
>
> ![[class-example-12.jpg]]

#### Passive Perception

Sometimes I will determine whether your character notices something without asking you to make a Wisdom (Perception) check; To do this I use your Passive Perception instead. Passive Perception is a score that reflects a general awareness of your surroundings when you’re not actively looking for something. Use this formula to determine your Passive Perception score:

**Passive Perception** = 10 + Wisdom (Perception) check modifier

Include all modifiers that apply to your Wisdom (Perception) checks. For example, if your character has a Wisdom of 15 and proficiency in the Perception skill, you have a Passive Perception of 14 (10 + 2 for your Wisdom modifier + 2 for proficiency).

>[!example]
>Fisty’s passive perception is equal to 10 + his WIS modifier (+4). He is not proficient in perception, so his total passive perception score is 14.

#### Hit Points

Your class and Constitution modifier determine your Hit Point maximum at any level. The number is calculated differently for different classes. For some campaigns, players roll a hit die each time they level up to determine how much HP they gain, but we will be using the average roll.

##### Hit Point Calculation by Class

|                    Class                     |         Hit Point Maximum         |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------:|
|                  Barbarian                   | (12 + Con) + (7 + Con)(Level - 1) |
|         Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger          | (10 + Con) + (6 + Con)(Level - 1) |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock | (8 + Con) + (5 + Con)(Level - 1)  |
|              Sorcerer or Wizard              | (6 + Con) + (4 + Con)(Level - 1)  |

>[!example]
>Fisty is a level 7 Monk. Therefore, his hit point maximum is (10 + CON (+1)) + (7 + CON (+1))(level (7) - 1).
>
>Therefore his hit point maximum is 59 HP.

#### Hit Point Dice

Your hit point dice type and number are determined by your class. The type is detemined by the following table.

##### Hit Point Dice by Class

|                    Class                     | Hit Point Maximum |
|:--------------------------------------------:|:-----------------:|
|                  Barbarian                   |  1d12 per Level   |
|         Fighter, Paladin, or Ranger          |  1d10 per Level   |
| Bard, Cleric, Druid, Monk, Rogue, or Warlock |   1d8 per Level   |
|              Sorcerer or Wizard              |   1d6 per Level   |

>[!example]
>As a level 7 Monk, Fisty has 7d8 as his hit dice.

#### Initiative

Write your Dexterity modifier in the space for Initiative on your character sheet.

>[!example]
>Fisty’s DEX modifier is +2, so his Initiative bonus is +2

#### Armor Class

Without armor or a shield, your base Armor Class is 10 plus your Dexterity modifier. If your starting equipment includes armor or a Shield (or both), calculate your AC using the rules in [[Armor]]. A class feature might give you a different way to calculate your AC.

>[!example]
>As a monk, Fisty has no proficiency in armor, so he wears none. However, because of his [[Monk#Level 1 Unarmored Defense|Unarmored Defense]] feature, his AC becomes 10 + DEX (+2) + WIS (+4).
>
>Therefore, his AC is 16.
