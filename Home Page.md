## Intro

[[The World of Marinthalis|Marinthalis]] is a vast and watery realm covered by a giant ocean, dotted with countless islands of varying sizes. For centuries, sailors have explored this world, fishing, trading, and seeking adventure amidst the waves. A giant storm called [[The World of Marinthalis#The Wild Tempest|The Wild Tempest]] covers a large portion of the world.

The Wild Tempest is an immense, rolling, and magical storm that engulfs a large swath of Marinthalis’ ocean. No one knows its origin or purpose. It rages with a tempestuous and magical fury, making its borders difficult to penetrate and the area within the storm‘s boundaries seemingly impossible to navigate.

The three main cities are [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur’s Gate]], located at the entrance to the Wild Tempest; [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Neverwinter|Neverwinter]], located in The Wild Tempest along the explored trade route; and [[The World of Marinthalis#Waterdeep|Waterdeep]], located deep underwater beneath [[The World of Marinthalis#The Midtempest Boundary|The Midtempest Boundary]].
