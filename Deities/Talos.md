# Talos

![[sea-twisters-banner.jpg|banner]]
![[talos-symbol.webp|float-right|relative|hs-med|border]]Talos is the god of storms, chaos, and destruction. His domain is over anywhere were chaos flourishes, be it in a storm or a wildfire. Commonly thought to be evil, Talos simply governs the natural chaos of world. Because of this misunderstanding, he is commonly referred to as *"The Destroyer"* by those who do not follow him. True followers do not tolerate this name as they view it as disrespectful. Those who worship Talos pray to him for safe passage though storms and other natural disasters, referring to him as *"He Who Controls Chaos"*. Talos' holy symbol consists of three lightning bolts radiating from a center point.
