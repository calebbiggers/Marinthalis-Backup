![[scribe.jpg|banner]]
![[oghma-symbol.webp|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Oghma is the god of inspiration, invention, and knowledge. Oghma's domain is nothing less than the whole of knowledge and thoughts, whether they are written down, spoken aloud, or even remains in the mind, for the idea is the purest and highest incarnation of knowledge. Also known as *"The Lord of Knowledge"* and *"The Binder of What is Known"*, Oghma has the distinction of being revered by beings of every race, stratum of society, philosophy, and moral alignment. All folk who value, preserve, share, sought, create, or uncovere knowledge and learning could be followers of Oghma and anyone looking for information, especially if it was lost or concealed, would say a prayer to him and beseech him for a blessing.

In the city of [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate]], a large group of healers founded [[Groups & Organizations#Clerics of Oghma|The Clerics of Oghma]]. This organization is made up of doctors and researchers all coming together in the pursuit of medical knowledge.
