# Overgrown Storm Warden Temple

This underground structure was once a temple of the [[Storm Wardens]] where they could worship [[Talos]]. The structure consists of a staircase carved into a stone sitting above ground, a large open cavern, and an inner sanctum blocked by a stone door.

## Entrance & Staircase

Visible from the beach is a large boulder jutting out of the ground. At first glance the boulder looks unassuming, but closer inspection reveals more. Tooling marks can be seen on the various faces of the stone alluding to the purposeful nature of the structure. On one side of large stone, hidden by overgrown vegetation, is an opening containing a staircase leading down into the earth. The staircase, cold and damp, leads around 20 feet underground into a cavern.

## Cavern

The stairs open up into an open cavern. The large open space has carved natural stone walls and a stone tile floor. The area is dimly lit by holes in the ceiling from where vegetation and roots have broken up the soil.

Littered throughout the stone floor are 8 humanoid corpses. They must be years old as there is no flesh left, just bones and scraps of fabric. All of these corpses are wielding various weapons, all rusted over from time—except one. This corpses is holding [[Captain's Cutlass]], a barnacle colored but still in good condition saber.

### Four Storms Riddle

![[puzzle-runes-dm.png|border]]
Four of the stone tiles have runes carved into them. Anyone who can understand giant can recognize them as giant runes. The four runes represent: rain, ice, lightning, and air. Carved into a stone slab opposite the staircase is a [[Four Storms Puzzle|poem]]. The poem hints to which tile needs to be activated to enter the inner sanctum - Air.

Stepping on one of the other tiles—Rain, Ice, or Lightning—will summon a corresponding elemental to defend the temple. These protectors’ only goal is to eliminate any and all intruders.

## Inner Sanctum

Once the correct tile is activated, the stone slabs barring entrance to the inner sanctum slowly moves to the side revealing an inner chamber. This inner chamber is notable different than the previous cavern, made up of much more precise stonework. The plant life that had seeped into the previous cavern has not penetrated the sealed entrance. This room is a place of worship, with a grand statue of [[Talos]] standing and looking towards the entrance of the room. Seated in front of this statue are three more corpses. In stark contrast to the grotesque positions the corpses in the previous room bore, these forms almost seem to be in a sort of meditative position. All of these corpses have various individualized Oracle Relics on their person.

- [[Zephyr Kaelith]] - A tiefling corpse seated directly in front of the statue of Talos. Wearing a [[Shellguard Armor]] decorated with the symbol of Talos on the breastplate. Next to his peaceful body is a scrap of parchment.
	- Zephyr’s Oracle Relics are stored in an intricately carved driftwood box: *smoothed driftwood splinters, barnacle encrusted beads, sea-salt crystals, shark teeth.*
- [[Juno Dorneth]] - A halfling corpse. Dressed in more simple leather gear and wearing [[Mistwalker’s Armor]].
	- Juno’s Oracle Relics are stored in a glass jar: *braided dried kelp, spiral shells, glass beads, coral fragments.*
- [[Myr Otharion]] - A human corpse. Wearing similar leather gear, with a shield on his back. [[Animated Shield]]
	- Myr’s Oracle Relics are all strung into a necklace: *smoothed river rocks, small pieces of iron scrap, several sea-bird feathers, small fish bones.*

Time has causes most of the scrolls and literature in the room to be lost, but the stone carvings on the wall are still legible. There are depictions of wardens finding and selecting their oracle relics and choosing how to store them.
