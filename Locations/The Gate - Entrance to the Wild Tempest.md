# The Gate - Entrance to the Wild Tempest

> [!reading]
> As your ship approaches the towering statues that mark the entrance to the Wild Tempest, the air grows heavy with anticipation. Each statue, ancient and worn by the relentless ocean winds, rises from the sea with arms outstretched, their stern faces gazing out into the tempest beyond. Between them, the sea swirls into a vortex of churning waves and erratic currents, creating the only navigable path into the storm. As you sail through the gap, the once familiar sky shifts, darkening with swirling clouds, and the wind howls like a living thing. Behind you, the statues stand like sentinels, watching as you cross the threshold into the chaotic heart of the Wild Tempest.

The entrance to [[The Wild Tempest]] located just off the shore to the Northwest of [[Baldur's Gate]]. On either side of the entrance are two massive stone statues.
