# The Para-Elemental Plane of Ice

![[plane-of-ice.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]The plane of para-elemental Ice, also known as the **Frostfell** was found between the planes of [[Elemental Plane of Water|Elemental Water]] and [[Elemental Plane of Air|Elemental Air]]. Scattered icebergs marked the border with Water, eventually becoming solid ice broken by fissures and caverns until finally jutting into the plane of Air as ice cliffs. This plane shared the restrictively solid nature of the [[Elemental Plane of Earth|Plane of Earth]]. Inadequately protected travelers would soon find themselves preserved for all time in sheer ice. Pockets of Water took the form of an underground lake while pockets of Air would form ice caverns of any shape or size.
