# The Elemental Plane of Air

![[plane-of-air.webp|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]This plane is the most hospitable to beings from the Primes because the substance of the plane was breathable and travel was fairly easy. The whole plane looks like the bluest sky on a summer day with only the occasional cloud or storm indicating the intrusion of some other element into the constant wind that was the Plane of Air. Pieces of solid matter floated in this realm and became home to other-planer creatures. The open space belongs to the [[Air Elementals]].
