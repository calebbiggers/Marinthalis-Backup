# The Grey Harbor

![[grey-harbor-at-night.webp|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]The Grey Harbor is the lifeblood of [[Baldur's Gate]], where ships from across [[Marinthalis]] dock in a haze of mist and salt. True to its name, the harbor is often shrouded in a thick fog that rolls in from the sea, giving it an eerie, ethereal atmosphere. The docks are always bustling with activity—sailors unloading goods, merchants haggling over prices, and adventurers preparing for journeys into [[The Wild Tempest]]. Despite the chaos, [[The Lower City]] is essential to the economic flow of Baldur’s Gate, bustling with energy, opportunity, and risk.
