# Strixhaven University

Strixhaven university is a magical college well known throughout [[Marinthalis]]. The fundamental work of Strixhaven University is the application of magic to academic study. Students and faculty aren’t limited to magical topics alone; they pursue studies in every facet of existence—magical or otherwise—applying magic to whatever they study. At Strixhaven, historians call the spirits of the dead to aid their lessons about the past, and arcano-biologists use necromancy to pull at life and coax out death when teaching about the natural world. Simultaneously, mage-artists sculpt elemental energy to create animate art, and arcane symbologists teach students how to recognize and understand the magical glyphs they encounter.

## Principles and Polarities

The colleges and curriculum at Strixhaven are organized around the idea of philosophical principles joined in concordant opposition. Each school embraces the paradoxical unity of two polar principles: life and death, order and chaos, reason and emotion, and so on. [[The Founders|The Five Founders]] are thought to embody the coexistence of these principles, while the ten deans of the colleges stand for the individual principles distinguished from their opposites.

A student’s course of learning at Strixhaven involves exploring the tension between these opposing principles, which typically involves late-night arguments in residence halls and study rooms. The university’s teaching philosophy is built on the idea that exploring opposites leads to an understanding of a greater whole. Most people believe that only a being with the wisdom (and long life) can truly master both halves of a school’s dichotomy, but a mage must learn at least the rudiments of those halves. A Strixhaven graduate is expected to leave the university prepared to argue the fundamental issues of their school’s philosophies.

## Faculty

The faculty members of Strixhaven are mages and scholars—experts in their various fields and in the use of magic to enhance their studies. They are dedicated to their research and to educating generations of mage-students who follow in their footsteps. Some faculty members value research more than teaching, while others make education their highest priority. But all find some balance between the two.

### Instructors

Strixhaven’s faculty begin their careers as instructors, focusing primarily on teaching classes and crafting curriculum, while the school administration evaluates their performance. At the end of a provisional period, which can last from one to several years, an instructor is elevated to the rank of professor or let go.

### Professors

Professors who have distinguished themselves over the course of a long career—typically at least twenty years—hope to be recognized with the title of esteemed professor. This honor is bestowed in recognition of groundbreaking research as well as exceptional teaching.

Upon retiring, a professor receives the title of _Mage Emeritus_. Mages Emeriti are held in high esteem and welcomed to campus as guest lecturers.

## Students

Students at Strixhaven spend their first year in a course of general studies, which lays the foundation for the more specialized work to follow. During this year, they wear a uniform of black, white, and gray. They’re encouraged to study broadly so that they become acquainted with a wide range of disciplines.

First-year students live in dormitories located on [[Stirxhaven Central Campus|The Central Campus]] and often form close friendships there that last throughout their educational careers, even when members of tight-knit groups of friends join different colleges in their second year. A few students continue to live on central campus after choosing a college, particularly if they pursue extensive studies in multiple colleges or work as resident advisers to first-year students. But most students move to dormitories located on their chosen college’s campus in their second year.

### Choosing a College

 Before starting their second year of studies, students choose one of the five colleges—[[Lorehold College|Lorehold]], [[Prismari College|Prismari]], [[Quandrix College|Quandrix]], [[Silverquill College|Silverquill]], or [[Witherbloom College|Witherblom]]—to be their academic home for the remainder of their education. From this point, students wear uniforms featuring the colors of their college, though these outfits aren't as unvarying as the first-year garb.

#### Two Counselors

Upon choosing a college, a student is assigned two professors to serve as counselors to help the student plan a course of studies. The two deans of the college assign these two counselors, who represent the poles of the college's philosophical opposition. By design, the two counselors tend to offer conflicting advice, forcing the student to navigate opposing principles. For example, a student pursuing historical studies in Lorehold College might have one counselor who focuses on the unpredictable, war-filled chaos of historical reality and another who dwells on the idea of an orderly progression toward an ideal. The former might encourage the student to choose courses based on gut feeling, to delve into the military aspects of an issue, and to supplement their academic studies with some practical martial training. The other counselor, meanwhile, might offer several ordered, rational proposals for course selection, focus on the political and human aspects of historical issues, and place less emphasis on martial prowess. The student must then navigate this conflicting advice and chart their own course.

#### Course of Study

Some students, having chosen a college, spend virtually all their remaining school years on that campus and study with those professors, diving into their preferred area of study and related fields. Other students take as many as a third of their classes in other colleges, continuing the breadth of their first-year education and looking for places where the perspectives of other disciplines can bring new insight to their studies. Both approaches are encouraged at the university.

### After Strixhaven

A student’s course of study at Strixhaven lasts at least four years but allows for advanced study for several years beyond that time frame. Most students eventually graduate, though, and they walk a variety of paths after leaving the university. Many return to whatever home they came from, putting what they have learned to use in their communities. Some mages travel the world in search of ever-greater magic, continuing their research in some form beyond the confines of an academic program. A few alumni return to Strixhaven, sooner or later, as instructors themselves, and a small, select number join the [[The Azure Pact]], an elite force of [[The Isleguard|Isleguard]] mages.

## Administration

The day-to-day functioning of Strixhaven relies on hundreds of laborers, clerks, coaches, administrators, and others. These personnel include folk like [[Mavinda Sharpbeak]], the kindly [[Aarakocra#Owlin|Owlin]] guidance counselor who takes first-year students under her wing, and [[Gyome]], the troll chef of [[Witherbloom College]]. In addition to legions of people who devote their lives to the university’s operations, numerous automatons and artificial life-forms—various kinds of Constructs—serve in various roles, including campus guides and library assistants.

All these operations are managed by an administration overseen by the ten deans, two in each college. Each dean is an esteemed professor who embraces one side of their school’s philosophical dichotomy. The deans, like the professors who serve as counselors to students, view it as their role to disagree with each other and guide the college by way of their arguments. Furthermore, rivalries among the deans only exacerbate this combative attitude.

When the argumentative deans fail to chart a coherent course for Strixhaven, [[The Founders]] are occasionally forced to intervene. They don’t step in directly, but a director known as the [[Voice of the Founders]]—currently an imposing man named [[Taiva]]—speaks on their behalf.

## Mascots

Each of Strixhaven’s five colleges has a mascot—a small creature associated with the magic of the school and often found wandering their respective campuses. Witherbloom’s mascots, pests, are naturally found in the world around the campus. The other colleges’ mascots are brought into being through magic. The Strixhaven Mascots table lists the mascots by college.

| College | Mascot |
| ----------------------- | ---------------------- |
| [[Lorehold College]] | [[Spirit Statue Mascot]] |
| [[Prismari College]] | [[Art Elemental Mascot]] |
| [[Quandrix College]] | [[Fractal Mascot]] |
| [[Silverquill College]] | [[Inkling Mascot]] |
| [[Witherbloom College]] | [[Pest Mascot]] |

The five kinds of mascots act as companions for students and faculty, sometimes serving as willing subjects for experiments or demonstrations, and occasionally even helping out in a duel or a more serious combat situation. Most notably, mascots are also playing pieces of sorts in the Strixhaven sport of [[Mage Tower]].

## Campus Overview

Strixhaven occupies hundreds of acres, spread out over six campuses across [[Marinthalis]]. Each of the university’s five colleges has its own campus, and [[The Central Campus]], home to [[The Biblioplex]] and [[Strixhaven Stadium]], serves as a hub for university life.

[[The Central Campus]] is located in [[Baldur's Gate]], but its five distinct colleges are spread across the world, each nestled in a location best suited to its unique magical discipline. This decentralized structure allows students to fully immerse themselves in specialized fields of study. Each campus has multiple permanent teleportation circles, which faculty and students can use, and several magical portals exist as well. These portals can be unpredictable: they aren’t necessarily open all the time, they don’t always lead to the same places, and some require complicated conditions or keys to open.
