# The Upper City

 The Upper City is home to the wealthiest citizens of [[Baldur's Gate]], including powerful merchants, politicians, and members of the [[The Council of Isles]]. The streets are clean, orderly, and free of the chaos that defines [[The Lower City]]. As the center of governance and wealth, the Upper City is where decisions are made that shape not only Baldurâ€™s Gate but also the broader world of [[Marinthalis]].
