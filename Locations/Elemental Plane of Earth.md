# The Elemental Plane of Earth

![[plane-of-earth.webp|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]More inhospitable than even the Plane of Fire, the Plane of Elemental Earth is so solid that movement is nearly impossible unless a traveler can find a pocket of some less dense element or use magic to force an opening or permit them to walk through solid material. Without some protection, a non-native being would be caught like a fly in amber, under tremendous pressure from the surrounding rock and without air to breathe or light to see.
