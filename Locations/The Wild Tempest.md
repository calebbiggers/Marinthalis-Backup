# The Wild Tempest

The Wild Tempest is an immense, rolling storm that engulfs a large swath of [[Marinthalis]]' ocean. No one knows its origin or purpose. It rages with a tempestuous and magical fury, making its boundary difficult to penetrate and the storm itself seemingly impossible to navigate.
