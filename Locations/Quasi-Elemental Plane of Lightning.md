# The Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning

![[plane-of-lightning-banner.webp|banner]]

There are three main components to the composition of the Plane of Lightning. The first two encompass most of the Plane: The Maelstrom, an infinite thunderstorm of various hues, crackling with electricity and howling with winds that can match the force of five gale-force hurricanes, and the immense slabs of earth that drift endlessly within it, forming its “continents”. The largest of these continents, contains most of the plane's settled civilizations, is the floating continent of Ukko. No seas exist on this plane, and any water from the deafening rainstorms that occur over the landmasses pool on the earth, only to run off the edge and cascade back into the tumbling storm of the Maelstrom. The “sky” to loosely use such a term, is always darkened with rolling thunderheads, and the sound of crashing thunder echoes endlessly everywhere in the plane. 

The Third part of the Plane of Lightning is the central core, which the landmasses seem to orbit and where most of the air currents of the Maelstrom eventually lead. This core, a swirling vortex of bright light, is the only natural light source on the Plane of Lighting besides the constant flashes of thunderbolts. This vortex, called “the Roilwell” by the inhabitants of the plane, both draws matter towards the centre and pushes other matter outward, cycling the material on the plane. It is theorized that the Roilwell is what keeps the plane constantly moving, providing its gravity while at the same time exerting an unknown pushing force that prevents all matter on the plane from simply being sucked into its vortex.

The Plane of Lightning is an unusually popular destination for adventurers and treasure-hunters for a couple of reasons. The first is that the Maelstrom is ever-changing and impermanent, and with the shifting of the floating continents, no single power or establishment can feasibly stake any sort of legal claim on anything discovered there. The second and most important: Treasure. For unknown reasons, there are many cases of great material wealth simply floating in the Maelstrom, from smelted gold bars to magical scrolls to carved statues of marble. Scholars theorize that these goods are remnants of treasure hoards from the, transported to the Plane of Lightning by an “Energy Gate” opening up at places of lightning strikes, such as treasure-laden galleons crossing stormy seas. The goods are then scattered across the Maelstrom, kept largely intact in almost suspended animation, a possible side effect from the plane’s close proximity to the Plane of Life.

Given the near-constant thunderstorms and rapid formation of thunderclouds, rain is abundant, and fresh water easy to come by. Lush rainforests of the temperate and tropical variety are common in the Plane of Lightning. Other climates commonly found are plains and shrublands, as well as the vast Savannahs on some of the drier land masses. In these drier places, travelers should be wary of wildfires, as the constant lightning strikes are quick to set these areas ablaze
