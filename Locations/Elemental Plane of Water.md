# The Elemental Plane of Water

![[plane-of-water.webp|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]An ocean without a surface, the Plane of Elemental Water has uniform pressure in all directions and feels like being several feet below the surface of a typical body of water in a Prime Material Plane, and indeed was illuminated with the same soft light of that depth. The salinity of the water varies depending on proximity to the [[Negative Energy plane]]â€”pure salt at the boundary with the quasi-elemental Plane of Salt, briny as you move away, becoming pure and fresh in the middle, then getting warmer and more agitated as you approached the quasi-elemental [[Plane of Steam]]. Pockets of the other elements can be found here, but travelers that required air to breathe needed to make other arrangements.
