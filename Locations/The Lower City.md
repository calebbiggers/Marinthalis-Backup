# The Lower City

![[lower-city.png]]
The Lower City of [[Baldur's Gate]] is a dense, fog-covered district teeming with life and activity. With its proximity to [[The Grey Harbor]], the Lower City is a hub of trade, drawing merchants, sailors, and adventurers from across Marinthalis. However, the reduced presence of the [[The Isleguard]] compared to [[The Upper City]] makes it a hotbed for crime and smuggling, where shadowy deals and illicit activities thrive in the narrow, winding streets. The Lower City is a place of opportunity and danger, where the line between fortune and ruin is razor-thin.
