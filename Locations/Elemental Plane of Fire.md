# The Elemental Plane of Fire

![[plane-of-fire.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]The Plane of Elemental Fire is a hellish place, filled with all manner and color of flame from the candle to the white-hot glow of heated steel, all burning without fuel and radiating light and heat at maximum levels. Most unprotected matter is quickly consumed by the flames but pockets of other elements could survive in "cold spots" where the temperature was near that of a hot Prime desert. The evil [[Efreet]] and their fabled [[City of Brass]] reside here.
