# Grommet Payne

![[grommet-wanted-poster.png|float-right|250]]The pirate captain of the [[The Barrel Pirates]]. Gnar looks up to him as a father figure. Grommet treats his crew like family and lives by his own personal code of freedom, friendship, and something else not as virtuous. He has no respect for government or laws, but he’ll keep his word and defend his crew and ship. He doesn’t mind stealing or killing if it’s done in the name of something good in his book. He’s chaotic good.
