# Lock on an Open Door

![[lock_image.jpeg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Lock is a young [[Tabaxi]] [[Paladin]] ([[Oath of the Open Sea]]) with bright orange fur and an agile tail. Known for his speed and climbing ability, Lock is a natural adventurer who dreams of following in his older brotherâ€™s footsteps. Despite his physical talents, Lock is still finding his confidence, often questioning his abilities and worth.

Lock grew up idolizing his brother [[NPCs#Storm of Ferocity|Storm of Ferocity]], a famous pirate, and has spent much of his life trying to live up to that legacy. His adventurous spirit led him to join the crew, where he has found camaraderie and a sense of purpose. Though unsure of himself, Lock is slowly discovering his strength and courage through his journey with his newfound friends.
