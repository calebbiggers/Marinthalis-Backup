# Otto Higgins

![[NPC-Banner.jpg|banner]]


![[otto-image.png|float-right|250]]An elderly [[Gnome]] tinkerer with greying blue hair, thick rimmed glasses, and hunched posture; Otto was like a father to [[Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]] during her childhood. A talented inventor, Otto specializes in creating helpful gadgets and gizmos. As a family friend, Otto looked after Keiran while her mother was busy, initially inviting her over to play with his adopted daughter, [[Beatrice Higgins|Beatrice]]]. Over time, Keiran's interest in Otto's work grew, leading to a close mentor-apprentice relationship.

## Description

Super old man, grey hair, thick glasses, hunched over.
