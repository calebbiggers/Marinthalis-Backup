# Shirina

Shirina was once a member of the [[Raven Queenâ€™s Court]]. Her lust for power drove her to attempt to expand her domain within [[The Shadowfell]]. She was caught trying to gather power from the other members of the court and exiled from the Shadowfell. After her banishment, she was spat out of that dark realm at [[Ylar Shadowfell Portal]] guarded by [[The Ylar Clan ]].
