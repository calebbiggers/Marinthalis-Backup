## Notes

-  In [[Lampool]], the players intercepted a manta-pseudodragon being smuggled to him by [[The Tide Syndicate]]. After rescuing the creature, the players vowed to get revenge on him.
- Upon arriving at Baldur’s Gate, the players crashed an auction party of his. In the chaos, the players attacked him, stealing his control circlet, cutting off his leg, and leaving him for dead.
