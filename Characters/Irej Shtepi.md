# Irej Shtepi

![[shtepi_image.png|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Shtepi is an elderly [[Loxodon]] [[Cleric]] ([[Life Domain]]) who walks with a cane due to a lingering leg injury. Once strong and vibrant, he is now a shadow of his former self, relying on a self-made concoction of drugs to dull his constant pain. Despite his physical decline and addiction, Shtepi remains devoted to his purpose as a healer and cleric, driven by an unyielding desire to help those in need.

Shtepi serves as a [[Groups & Organizations#Clerics of Oghma|Cleric of Oghma]], a scholarly order dedicated to the pursuit and application of medical knowledge. His journey brought him to the island of [[The World of Marinthalis#Stygia|Stygia]] to aid the locals against shadow creatures. While trying to save a friend, Shtepi sustained a severe leg injury that never fully healed, leaving him dependent on his medicinal creations. Despite the physical and mental toll, Shtepi’s spirit endures, and he continues his work as a healer while searching for true relief from his pain.

When the party arrived in Stygia, they were greeting by an island overrun by a shadow plague. After working with the locals, the party was able to defeat [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]], the [[Shadar-Kai]] responsible. The island now saved, Shtepi decided to stay in order to further help the population, saying goodbye to the crew.

## History

Shtepi was the most gifted medical cleric of his temple. His ability to detect and identify subtle symptoms and patterns really set him apart. The typically goofy, snarky, and prank-loving guy he was fizzled away when his life took a dark turn. He was called into battle to heal his injured companions when they faced a relentless onslaught of supernatural creatures. In the midst of the chaos, Shtepi was gravely injured, his leg marked by sinister shadows that refused to fade. The chronic pain from his injuries was relentless, and it seemed that the shadows had tainted his very soul.

Desperate to find relief from the unending torment, he turned to a local underground network of healers and alchemists who offered potent narcotics and elixirs. These substances provided him with temporary respite from his pain and a fleeting escape from the shadowy horrors that haunted him day and night. Slowly but surely, Shtepi became addicted to the drugs, finding himself trapped in a vicious cycle of dependency and regular hallucinations.

Jaded and bitter from the agony, he lost faith in his god, Diancecht. His spiral caused his cleric community to reject him, further deepening his pain. His journey is now twofold: to break free from his addiction and to confront the sinister shadows that still linger within him. He roams the land as a tormented cleric-doctor, seeking out those who suffer and offering them medical care. Shtepi’s path is one of redemption and self-discovery as he battles his own inner darkness while striving to heal the wounds of the world. 

A glimmer of hope remains with Shtepi, knowing that his skill will always remain with him. Oftentimes, surging through him as sudden moments of realization. Perhaps his hallucinations are not as they seem?
