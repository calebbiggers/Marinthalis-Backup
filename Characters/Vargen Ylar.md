# Vargen Ylar

>[!link] LInk to D&D Beyond Character [Vargen](https://www.dndbeyond.com/characters/134431785)

![[vargen-image.PNG|float-right|250]]A middle-aged man with dense greying hair and a beard. A rough looking man, he has a deep scar running through his right eye. Well respected, he is the current leader of the town of [[The World of Marinthalis#The Refuge of Kletva|Kletva]] on the island of [[The World of Marinthalis#Stygia|Stygia]].

[[Groups & Organizations#Clan Ylar|The Ylar Clan]] was a hermit family that has guarded a portal to the [[Shadowfell]] in [[The World of Marinthalis#Stygia|Stygia]] for centuries. Around six years ago, [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]], after being banished from the Shadowfell, emerged from the portal and decided to make the island her new domain. Attempting to defend the portal, Vargen, and his family attempted to stop her, but in the process Vargen’s family were all turned into shadow creatures. Due to their nature as lynathropes and history with transformations, Vargens family was able to briefly resist for long enough for Vargen to kill them.

Vargen was able to escape with his life, as Shirina relished in his despair and allowed him to leave. After this defeat, Vargen spent two years in the forests of Stygia in grief. After this, Vargen decided to seek vengeance and came to Kletva to help defend the city from the shadow plague. Over the years, as the city became more and more destroyed Vargen became the de-facto leader of the town.

## Description

>[!quote] Read To Players
>Before you stands Vargen Ylar, a broad-shouldered man with dense grey hair streaked with white, hanging down to frame his rugged, weathered face. His thick beard is colored with the same grey. A deep scar cuts across his right eye, leaving it clouded and cold. His remaining eye, sharp and focused, you notice has been scanning you all up and down where you stand. He wears thick, spiked leather armor with a round silver crest adorning his chest. The armor‘s rough surface is scarred and worn from countless battles. Resting against his shoulder is a massive, well-used great axe, its handle worn smooth from years of use.

## Background Notes for Playing Vargen

- The Ylar Clan is unique amongst lycanthropes in that they are taught from a young age to control their transformations. Outside of any major arcane lunar events, they would not unwillingly transform.
- Lycanthropy is not guaranteed to pass from parent to child. Any Ylar children that were not born with the curse were bitten after birth. This leaves a bite shaped scar on their bodies that never fully disappears. Vargen did not inherit the curse, so somewhere on his body is the scar from his father’s bite.
- Members of the Ylar Clan have a deep respect for their lycanthropic nature. They recognize its potential as a powerful boon, but also as a dangerous curse if spread. A member of the clan would not willingly spread the curse to a non-member unless in dire circumstances, and even then it would have it be with good reason to someone trustworthy.
- Knowing the general opinions of werewolves, Vargen has kept his curse a secret. He would not reveal his hybrid form to anyone he doesn’t fully trust unless in dire circumstances. As far as Vargen is aware, none of the town members are aware of his affliction.
- There are rumors amongst the townsfolk of a wolf creature seen defending against the creatures of the shadowfell. This creature is referred to as “The Wolf of Kletva”. But these are just rumors. Vargen is aware of these rumors.
- Because his family has guarded the secret portal to the Shadowfell, Vargen grew up learning about the various creatures and aspects of the dark realm. However, none of the family ever dared to venture into the portal, so none of this knowledge is firsthand.
- The Ylar clan’s ability to resist the curse is thought to be a blessing from [[Selûne]] and as such all members worship the goddess of the moon. The current last bastion of survivors is a church of Selûne located in the town.
- Vargen has fond memories of his family. They lived in the forests of Stygia near the portal they guarded. The family lived as hermits, never venturing into the populated areas of the island.
- The night that [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]] was expelled from the shadowfell, the family cautiously greeted her. Shirina then summoned [[Shadow Ghouls]]. In the battle, these creatures infected the members of Vargen’s family with their shadow curse, turning them into shadow monsters under Shirina’s control. Vargen, being the swiftest of the family, was not infected.
- Perhaps due to the family natural aversion to curses, Vargen’s family was able to briefly resist the shadow transformation, long enough for his father, Blaidd, to give Vargen [[Vargen’s Greataxe|his greataxe]] and plead for Vargen to kill them before Shirina gained control of 5 shadow-empowered werewolves. Vargen used his father’s axe to mercifully kill his family as Shirina relished in the awful situation and his misery. The fact that he had to kill his family is something he still struggles with.
- In the battle with Shirina, none of the Ylar clan shifted as they were caught by surprise while trying to discern her intentions. As such, Vargen is unsure if Shirina has learned of his werewolf nature, although he does secretly use his werewolf form to defeat shadow creatures time to time.
- In combat, Vargen fights with his father’s greateaxe, two-handing the weapon. If he shifts, he wields the large axe easily with one hand, while also using the claws on his other hand. In his werewolf form, Vargen remains in control but does fight slightly more recklessly.
- Vargen is very distrustful of outsiders due to years of fighting and waiting for assistance from [[Groups & Organizations#The Council of Isles|The Council of Isles]]. He is also very aware of how the shadow-curse can be spread by shadow ghouls. He wears full coverage leather armor to combat their bites, and is very cautious of anyone who has encountered them in case they have been bitten.
- Vargen is aware that various groups have attempted to aid the island, but was not present at the time as he was still in self-imposed exile.
- The shadow plague that has been afflicting the island for years began slowly. With shadow ghouls attacks being rare and random. Over the years it grew worse and worse, as the portal to the shadowfell, left unguarded, was free for the creatures to enter the material plane. Only in recently months has it gotten bad enough that the remaining residents of the island have been forced to confine themselves to their makeshift fortress around the temple of Selûne.
- Since returning from his self imposed exile around 4 years ago, Vargen has become a trusted leader of the community of [[The World of Marinthalis#The Refuge of Kletva|Kletva]].
- Vargen is aware that [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]] is behind the shadow plague, and knows she probably resides near the portal once guarded by his family. However, he also knows that the current occupants of the town are no match for her and her various shadow beasts. Even so, Vargen wants nothing more than vengeance for his family and for Shirina to be defeated.
- The island has been waiting for help from [[Groups & Organizations#The Council of Isles|The Council of Isles]] for years without notice. Because of the shadow plague, the islands once profitable exportation of obsidian mined from the volcanic has been halted.
