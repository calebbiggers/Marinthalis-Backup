# Athair Ar Neamh Rosewater

![[Athair.png|float-right|250]]The youngest child of the Rosewater family. She was very quiet and often could be found with [[Amarantine Rosewater|Amarantine]] while she was practicing her magic abilities. [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] didn’t interact very much with his sister except for when they would go sea-shell searching by the seashore. Athair had a much better eye than Gnar did. Gnar remembers his sister as quiet, kind to animals, and being very young.

## Description

Captain Althair is a young halfling woman with a commanding presence despite her small stature. Her chestnut-brown hair is often tied back in a simple braid, framing her bright, determined eyes. Known for her strategic mind and fierce loyalty to her crew, Mira rose through the ranks swiftly, earning the respect of even the tallest sailors. Though she maintains a tough exterior, there’s a warmth to her when she’s with those she trusts, especially when it comes to her sibling.
