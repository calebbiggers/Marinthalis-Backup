# Rem Ackes

Rem Ackes is a strong-willed half-orc woman with a quiet resilience. While her outward demeanor is calm and composed, the disappearance of her husband, [[Weylan Ackes]] has shaken her deeply. Desperate to find him, she was overheard pleading with [[Eda Oweland]] to organize a search party, showing just how far her loyalty and love for her husband extends. Remâ€™s life in [[Saltmarsh]] has made her tough, and though not a warrior like her husband, her presence commands respect within the community. She is known for her determination and will not rest until she finds out what happened to Weylan.

## Notes

- Confronted [[Eda Oweland]] about her missing husband. The party overheard the argument at the town council building.
