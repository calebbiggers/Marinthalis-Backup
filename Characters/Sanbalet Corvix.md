# Sanbalet Corvix

![[sanbalet-wanted-poster.png|float-right|250]]Vice Captain of the [[The Tide Syndicate]] smugglers. Sanbalet was stationed in the undergroup docking area beneath [[The Alchemist's Home|The Haunted House]] in Lampool. He was captured by the party. As charismatic as he is cunning, Sanbalet is a plotting nemesis who prefers manipulation to direct action.

- **_What He Wants._** The smuggler wants to expand his operation and eventually inhabit a more secure location to better pursue his magical studies. He’d sacrifice every one of his companions to achieve these ends.
- **_Confidence Aplenty._** Sanbalet’s success stems from confidence in his abilities. He delights in criminal behavior and considers himself a great villain. He speaks of himself in the third person and exhibits narcissistic tendencies.

## Notes

- Sanbalet was captured by the players after their confrontation at the [[The Alchemist's Home]]. His left leg was cut off by [[Lock on an Open Door|Lock]] and wrapped by [[Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]]. He was locked in the alchemists lair for 2 days and then locked in the brig of [[The Peggy-Lou]].
