# Gnolak Rosewater

The middle child of the Rosewater’s. He was an ill-tempered child who scared the other children of the village with his penchant for chaos and violence. He’d jump off his father’s fishing boat and catch fish with his bare teeth. He and [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] would have acrobatic competitions- racing each other jumping from mast to mast on his father’s ship until one of them would grow so weak they’d be able to push the other off the boat. Gnar usually lost at this game. Gnar remembers Gnolak as his pesky younger brother. They were very different, but also shared some similarities in their combat styles and short tempers.
