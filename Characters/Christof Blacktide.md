Christof Blacktide is a name known by any seafaring resident of Marinthalis. Captain Blacktide was an [[Elf|Elven]] man that led the first successful mapping expeditions into[[The Wild Tempest]] in 884 PT. He was eventually successful and his expeditions led to the creation of the first [[Node Compass|Node Compasses]] in 893 PT. This tool allows ships to navigate between the two capital cities within the tempest: [[Neverwinter]] and [[Waterdeep]].
