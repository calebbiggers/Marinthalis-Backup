# Yaw'goo Bhagar

![[yawgoo-wanted-poster.jpg|float-right|250]]Yaw'goo is a member of [[The Whisper Pirates]]. He was a part of the original crew that attacked the island of [[Isaola]] and kidnapped [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]]'s family. Gnar briefly fought him during his escape, cracking his shell. Now Yaw'goo is a Captain of one of the many ships in control of [[Edina Drakkar|Edina Drakkar]].

The party ambushed him and his crew in [[Baldur's Gate]]. In the battle Yaw'goo was captured along with [[Borgos Leon]]. When the crew interrogated him, Yaw'goo refused to give up any information on [[Edina Drakkar|Edina]], but he promised that Edina would kill [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] and his friends. After an interrogation, [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] killed him and turns some of his shell into pauldrons.

## Description

>[!quote] Read To Players
>As you approach, you see Yaw’goo, but he’s not the towering figure Gnar once knew. His frame, once large and commanding, has shrunk with age, and he now appears smaller and frail, his back hunched beneath the weight of his years. His shell, once a proud testament to his strength, now bears a jagged crack—crudely patched together with scraps of metal and rusted rivets. The crack runs deep, a scar from the fight with Gnar so many years ago, now barely holding together under the strain of time.
>
>His scales, once vibrant, have faded to a dull, weathered hue. His movements are slow and deliberate, each step a reminder of the battles he’s fought and the toll they’ve taken. Yet, despite his weakened state, there’s still a sharpness in his gaze—a flicker of the cunning and strength that made him dangerous in his prime.
