# Gnar Rosewater

![[gnar_image.png|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Gnar is a stoutly built [[Halfling]] [[Barbarian]] ([[Path of the Storm Herald]]) with pale skin, brown hair, and sharp brown eyes. Standing at 3'6", he wears a magical eyepatch over his injured eye, which features an embroidered dragon’s eye that moves as if alive. Scrappy, quick-tempered, and impulsive, Gnar is fiercely loyal to his friends, family, and crewmates. Though happy-spirited and flirty after a few drinks, he is deeply afraid of losing those he loves and struggles to form deeper romantic relationships.

Gnar grew up in the coastal village of [[The World of Marinthalis#Isaola|Isaola]], where he learned the family fishing trade. His life was forever changed when [[Groups & Organizations#The Whisper Pirates|The Whisper Pirates]] led by [[NPCs#Edina Drakkar|Edina Drakkar]] attacked his village, killing his father and capturing his family. Losing his eye in an attempt to save them, Gnar escaped by hiding in a wine barrel. Lat

## History

### Circumstances of Birth/Cultural Heritage

Halflings are traditionally peaceful people. However, Isoala has been an exception to the norm. They fight back when raiders and pirates try to siege their village. They value family and friendships. They love good seafood and lots of ale.

### Early Life

Gnar Rosewater was a playful and curious child born into a small coastal village called Isaola to a humble sailor-fisherman father, Olo, and a Wayfinder Oracle Master mother, Amarantine. Gnar was the eldest child of three in this barbarian halfling family. Gnar’s earliest memories are of helping his parents manage the family fishing trade with the combination of his father’s keen abilities to catch and harvest fish paired with his mother’s ability to predict and read nautical patterns and wayfind in any weather condition. Gnar’s family lived in this seaside village for generations. Gnar’s mother’s oracle wayfinding abilities were unusual with many questioning how she came to possess such an unfamiliar ability. 

Gnar had several friends in childhood like Armida and Rufus, but spent a majority of his time with his parents and siblings. Gnolak was the little brother who scared the other barbarian halflings. He would tear raw fish with his bare hands as a child. On the other hand, Athair Ar Neamh, was a soft and quiet soul who spent the majority of her time with their mother. Gnar is somewhere in the middle- he could hold his own in a fight, fish with his father, and accompany his mother with oracle readings. This all changed one day after a normal day’s fishing when Gnar’s village was raided by the infamous Edina “Mistress of Last Breath” Drakkar and her raiders arriving at the village’s small port. It was an absolute slaughter, with young Gnar witnessing the death of his father and being kidnapped along with his siblings and mother. These raiders had knowledge of his mother’s abilities and she was taken aboard their ship.

Gnar attempted to escape and save his mother and siblings shortly after their capture. Due to his combat inexperience, lack of strength, and age, Gnar failed miserably. He lost his eye in the scuffle and managed to escape the ship by floating away inside a wine barrel. After wandering out to a port village, Gnar joined a crew of pirates under Captain Grommet Payne. They trained him in their ways. Pirating became his life for as long as he lived with the other pirates. He studied the use of weapons and acrobatics, learned basic survival techniques, including how to stay alive in a siege on land and sea. 

### Middle/Adult Life

Gnar’s late teen/early adult life has been spent aboard Captain Grommet Payne’s pirate ship. He’s well traveled and protects his crewmates fiercely. He has a vice for lots of ale and foul-mouth story-telling. He’s a goofy lad who loves to make new friends, but is careful to let anyone get too close in fear of losing them. A pirate's life is dangerous and unpredictable- Gnar has lost some crewmates and friends over the years. However, he hasn’t nor does he plan on ever trading his pirate life on the seas for a life on the lands. 

### Inciting Adventuring Incident

Gnar has always had dreams about what happened in their village so long ago. The flashbacks are terrifying. Sometimes he wakes up with cold sweats and shaking with fear. That fear turns to rage and desire for revenge against those who killed his father and took his mother. However, these flashback dreams are becoming more intense and have been paired with a seemingly visit from a powerful entity alluding to the possibility of Gnar’s reunification with his mother. Gnar is confused and angry about what these dreams mean. He has been feeling the pull to venture out to find out what lies ahead and piece together the meaning of these odd dreams. And secure some sweet revenge on those mysterious raiders who slaughtered his family. 

## Current Motivation & Goals

Short term: I want to visit my home village of Isaola. I want to find out more about seafaring raiders who took my mother and siblings. 

Long term: I want to avenge my father and find my mother. I want to kill those who killed my father and I want to save my mother.

## Personality

Gnar is a real scrappy, happy-spirited, quick-tempered, and impulsive lad. He loves his friends, family, and crewmates fiercely. He holds a grudge for those who wrong them. Gnar hasn’t had many romantic relationships because he is afraid of losing anyone who gets too close. However, he loves to engage in flirty banter after a couple drinks at the port tavern, but it usually doesn’t go past talk. Gnar is bisexual. He is generally attracted to other halflings and races taller than him. Friendship is extremely important to Gnar.

No matter where Gnar goes, people are afraid of him due to his reputation. When he is in a settlement, he can get away with minor criminal offenses, such as refusing to pay for food at a tavern or breaking down doors at a local shop, since most people will not report Gnar’s activity to the authorities.

### Traits

- I stretch the truth for the sake of a good story. I love committing to the bit.
- I enjoy sailing into new ports and making new friends over a flagon of ale.

### Ideals

- People. I’m committed to my crewmates, not to ideals. (Neutral) 
- Freedom. The sea is freedom—the freedom to go anywhere and do anything. (Chaotic)

### Bonds

- Ruthless pirates murdered my father, plundered our village, and kidnapped my mother and siblings. Vengeance will be mine. 
- I’ll always remember my home village, Isoala, and my first crew on Grommet Payne’s ship.

### Flaws

- Once someone questions my courage, I never back down no matter how dangerous the situation.
- I can’t help but pocket loose coins and other trinkets I come across. Once I start drinking, it’s hard for me to stop. 
- I can’t stand being separated from my crewmates. I lose focus and become stressed.
