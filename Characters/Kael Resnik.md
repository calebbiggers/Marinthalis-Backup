# Kael Bloodhook

![[kael-resnik.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Kael is a [[Human]] [[Warlock]] ([[Great Old One Patron]]) and is the newest member of the crew. The party discovered him and his familiar [[Poe the Raven|Poe]] washed up on a [[The World of Marinthalis#A Small Remote Island|small remote island]]. Kael’s appearance is as rugged and storm-tossed. His long, dark hair is often windswept and tangled, and a beard that’s starting to show streaks of gray frames his sharp features. His eyes, however, tell the most about him—they’re a stormy mix of rage and sorrow, a reflection of the tempest that rages within him.

## Basic Info

- Kael is a tall burly human standing at 6’ 7’ who was born on the 3rd of Ches. He is 37 years old.
- Kael is a pirate. He was previously a member of [[The Strikers]], a pirate mercenary crew mostly operating within The Wild Tempest. Their current ship is called [[The Sea Wraith]].
- Kael is a warlock. He unknowingly connected himself to an unknown cosmic entity when he encountered a meteor on a job with his old pirate crew.
	>[!question] Are there any details of the job that are important and you want to flesh out?
- Kael is a widower whose late-wife was named Elena.

## Backstory

- Kael joined a pirate crew (_The Strikers_) as a young adult and at some point met and married Elena. He worked his way up until he became 1st mate.

	>[!question] Any specifics about how he came to join _The Strikers_ and how he met Elena?

	>[!question] Do you have a name for the captain of _The Strikers_?

- Kael vaguely knew that before they met Elena had a confrontation with another pirate crew led by [[Ranbur the Red]], but didn’t know the severity or reason for their conflict.
- Two years ago, on the twelfth of Uktar 1490 PT, _The Strikers_ were attacked. The attack was an ambush at sea. A large galleon with red sails and fire-spewing cannons quickly laid waste to (the old ship).
>[!question] Do you care what the old ship was called?
- In the initial surprise attack, Kael was knocked unconscious by a cannonball. The next thing Kael knew, he woke up on a row boat with the captain and a few other surviving crew members. Elena was nowhere to be found among the burning wreckage.
- Assuming her to be dead, Kael spent the next two years biding time to get his revenge against [[Ranbur the Red|Ranbur]] and his crew.
- Kael grew increasingly more reckless and erratic until a few days ago it reached a breaking point. _The Strikers_, fed up with his dangerous behavior, made him walk the plank.
- Kael managed to swim to the nearest island, where he promptly passed out on the beach.

## Where the Peggers Find Him

- The crew will encounter the small island he washed up on. He will be unconscious on the beach.
- If they don’t investigate the island, he will be found unconscious, floating on a piece of driftwood.
