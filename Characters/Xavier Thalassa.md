# Xavier Thalassa

Youngest elder brother of [[Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]]. Clearly has a lot of power but isn’t dedicated enough to train well so it can be unpredictable. His abilities fluctuate with his mental state/mood. Xavier is closest in age to Keiran so they have the closest bond. The two of them were always showing off their latest trick or invention to each other. He didn’t like training, so he would sneak off and hang out with Keiran sometimes. Briefly dated Beatrice When he was 17 and she was 15 before leaving town to pursue adventure. When he left home, it broke Keirans heart but she was excited for him.

Always distracted and forgetful. Probably has ADHD. Hates studying and practicing his magic, just wants to have fun. Very good heart. He doesn’t really understand the guns but encourages Keiran to pursue her dreams.

## Description

Medium height, blond hair, brown eyes, freckles.
