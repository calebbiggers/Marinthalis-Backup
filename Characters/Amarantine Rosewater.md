# Amarantine Rosewater

Amarantine is [[Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]]'s mother. She used her wayfinding oracle abilities to assist all aspects of the village life as it was affected by the weather and sea. Amarantine would use her [[Wayfinding Oracle Relics]] to predict, interpret, and aid navigation for Isaola’s fishermen, merchants, and travelers. Her family had also been in [[Isaola]] for generations and served in mixed trades, but mostly combat. They were dedicated followers of [[Talos]]. Amarantine’s abilities were unusual and surprised many people both within and outside her family when she began using them when she was quite young. Once a bubbly child, Amarantine’s personality shifted into a calm and reserved demeanor. She was known to get especially tired after a bad storm. Gnar remembers his mother as pious, moody, and a little mysterious.

## Family:

- [[Olo Rosewater]] (Husband)
- [[Gnar Rosewater]] (Son)
- [[Gnolak Rosewater]] (Son)
- [[Athair Ar Neamh Rosewater]] (Daughter)
