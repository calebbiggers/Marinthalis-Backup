# Hanna Rist

![[hanna_image.jpeg|float-right|250]]A young woman, Hanna owns [[The Snapping Line]] in [[Saltmarsh]] along with her wife, [[Arda Seaborne]]. Commonly working the bar in the tavern, Hanna is a serious, no nonsense woman who demands respect from her patrons, no matter how many times her size they are. She comes from a family of well-known lobster catchers. Her family also makes a spirit from lobster meat and potatoes called claw wine; it is, to put it mildly, an acquired taste.
