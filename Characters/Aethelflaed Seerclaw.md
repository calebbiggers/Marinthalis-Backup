# Aethelflaed Seerclaw

Aethel is an older owlin living in the refuge of [[Kletva]]. She has lived in [[Stygia]] her whole life. She is one of the refugees living outside the [[Church of Selune]]. Before the shadow plague took over the island, she owned a small shop where she performed divinations. The shop is a small canvas-topped treehouse in a large oak tree.

If the players ask, she will give them [[Aethel’s Tarot Readings - GM Version|tarot readings]] using her tarot deck.

## Description

>[!quote] Read To Players
>As you walk though the makeshift camp that has been built up around the church, you notice a , you notice a figure hunched within one of the small tents. The figure is shuffling a deck of worn, well-loved cards. She is a short, elderly Owlin woman, her frame slightly stooped with age, and brown feathers covering most of her body, though a patch of vibrant blue feathers adorns her head like a crown. Her worn, earthy robes drape around her, blending with the browns and greys of the tent and earth, and giving her a natural, unassuming presence.
>
>The fortune teller lights a small candle, casting flickering shadows across the table, and arranges a small stack of incense to burn slowly, filling the air with an earthy, mystical aroma. They shuffle the deck with steady hands, letting each card fall into place with practiced ease, the gentle swish of the cards setting a steady rhythm. Locking eyes with the player, the fortune teller asks them to focus on their past, present, and what they wish to know about their future.
>
>They offer the deck to the player, inviting them to cut it in a way that feels right to them, or to select three cards at random. The reader then lays these cards face down in a straight line across the table, representing a journey through time.
>
>Starting with the past, the fortune teller turns over the first card, pausing to let its significance settle. They might weave a story or share impressions of past experiences, challenges, or influences that have shaped the player. Moving to the present, the second card is revealed, and the reader speaks of what currently occupies the player’s life—obstacles, insights, or emotions that need attention. Finally, they turn the last card, representing the future, offering a glimpse of what lies ahead, whether as a warning, an opportunity, or a choice that the player can make to shape their destiny.
>
>Each interpretation is spoken with care, allowing the player to reflect and perhaps even ask questions as the fortune teller offers insights, making each card a bridge between past, present, and the unknown future.

## Notes

- If a player asks for a blessing or a reading of the future they can get 2 dice to roll as if from the [[Diviner#Level 3 Portent|Portent]] feature of Divination Wizard.
