# Keiran Thalassa

![[keiran_image.jpeg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Keiran is a striking [[Water Genasi]] [[Fighter]] ([[Gunslinger]]) with smooth blue skin and white hair, typically tied in a high bun. Her sharp, pointed ears and fluid movements reflect her elemental nature, though she lacks the magical abilities common to her family. Confident in her tinkering and mechanical skills, Keiran is headstrong and determined, with a quiet longing to prove herself and understand her origins.

As the youngest of the Thalassa family, Keiran grew up in [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Baldur's Gate|Baldur's Gate]], surrounded by powerful sorcerers, including her mother and three older brothers. Her mother claimed Keiran's father was a Marid, a water genie she met after her first husband's death, making Keiran a water genasi. Lacking the magical gifts of her siblings, Keiran turned to invention and mechanics, learning from a family friend, [[NPCs#Otto Higgins|Otto]], who became a father figure. Now, Keiran seeks to uncover her mysterious heritage while forging her own path.

## Description

Water Genasi (half genie, half human). Light blue skin, long white hair (half-up with sides braided up into a bun), lithe body with lean muscles. Bright Blue eyes.
