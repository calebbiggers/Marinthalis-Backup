# Ranbur the Red

>[!reading]
>_”The sea is no place for the weak. Those who can’t endure its trials are better off serving those who can.”_

![[z_Assets/Images/ranbur-the-red.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Ranbur the Red is captain of the [[Brazen Bull Pirates]], a group of slavers operating primarily within [[The Wild Tempest]]. Early in his career, Ranbur made a deal with the demon [[Bel]]. In exchange for a cut of the souls of those he captured, Ranbur was given a demonic power.

## Personality

Ranbur believes that it is the duty of the strong to subjugate the weak and take a lot of pride in his work.

## History

Ranbur has been a slaver for 17 years, and in this time he had never lost a quarry, until he met [[Elenna Bloodhook|Elanna]]. Elanna was a part of a group that Ranbur captured to be sold, but she was somehow able to escape. This infuriated Ranbur and he vowed to hunt her down, and un-tarnish his perfect record.
