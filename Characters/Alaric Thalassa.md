# Alaric Thalassa

Middle bother of [[Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]]. Sorcerer, shadow subclass. His magic isn’t that powerful. Sought out shadow magic cuz he thinks it makes him edgy. He’s not really edgy, but he wants to be. Used to taunt Keiran for not having magic and use his magic to pull pranks on her. But when things were serious, he always had her back. Middle-child attention-seeking behavior.

## Descriptiom

Tall, thin figured. Same dark hair as Thomas but blue eyes like [[Joan Thalassa|Joan]]

## Family:

- [[Joan Thalassa]] (Mother)
- [[Quinn Thalassa]] (Older Brother)
- [[Xavier Thalassa]] (Younger Brother)
