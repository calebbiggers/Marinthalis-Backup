# Joan Thalassa

![[NPC-Banner.jpg|banner]]

[[Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]]'s mother. Currently lives in Baldur's Gate. A respected sorcerer. Her connection to the moon ties into her love of the ocean tides. This is how she attracted the attention of a water genie.

Joan was generally a good mother, but her focus was always on training her sons in magic. She generally left Keiran to her own devices while she studied or practiced with the boys. She doesn’t like to talk about Keiran’s father, but often reminisces about the boys’ late father. She supported Keiran in pursuing her tinkering with Otto, but was against Keiran going off on her own. She wanted Keiran to stay home and live a quiet life while the boys go off on their own adventures. Thomas is clearly her favorite child.

## Description

Old white human lady. Hair was light brown in her youth, now gray. Bright blue eyes that match Keiran.

## Family

- [[Keiran Thalassa]] (daughter)
