## Background

Maeryn was born in Waterdeep to her fortune teller mother. Her conception was veiled in secrecy, as her biological father is of noble monarchical class in Waterdeep. Her sole purpose is to protect and conserve the seas and their creatures. She works passionately to defend all sea creatures, from whales and dolphins, to sharks and rays, to fish and krill, without exception.

**Traits**
- I’ve spent so long in the Mantledeep that I have little practical experience dealing with people in the outside world and outside of Waterdeep.
- I see omens in every event and action. The sea gods try to speak to us, we just need to listen.

**Ideals**
- Change. We must help bring about the changes the gods are constantly working in the world. (Chaotic)
- Aspiration. I seek to prove myself worthy of my god’s favor by matching my actions against his or her teachings. (Any)

**Bonds**
- Everything I do is for protection and harmony of the oceans and their creatures
- I owe my life to the Delphions who took me and trained me to protect my land and fellow sea creatures.

**Flaws**
- I hide a truly scandalous secret about the circumstances of my birth.
- I am suspicious of strangers and expect the worst of them.
- I am inflexible in my thinking.

### Personality

Maeryn is calm, cool and collected. She’s passionate about being a sea elf and a druid. She is closely connected with her fellow animals. She’s distrustful of human fishermen. Maeryn is polyamorous and has two romantic partners: Daphne Bluefin and Undine Havenshore. She’s also been having a fling with the pirate, Wallace Payne, with whom she met on one of her trips to Waterdeep. In her free time, she spends most of her time with her sea creature friends, playing her lyre, or visiting friends. 

### EARLY LIFE

Maeryn moved to a small sea elf village, [[Mantledeep]], just outside of Waterdeep when she was very young. Although she has made several trips to the city, they have been few and far between. Her mother told her of the circumstances of her birth and the presence of other bastard children in the city. Her druidic connection and connection with animals was present from an early age. These abilities were encouraged by her mother. Her mother, Saorise, was the esteemed fortune teller who made frequent visits to the noble classes of Waterdeep. Shortly after Maeryn’s birth, they were requested by the monarchy to relocate outside of Waterdeep as to not draw too much attention. Saorise still made trips into the city for palace parties and visits, but Maeryn did not. Instead she spent her time with the sea creatures, honing her druidic studies and abilities, and performing rites and service at the temple of Deep Sashelas in Mantledeep. 

### MIDDLE/ADULT LIFE

Maeryn has spent most of her adult life in Mantledeep and the outside lands of Waterdeep. She has become a more involved and devoted servant of Deep Sashelas and Trishina. She has joined a faction of Delphions who take their commitment to protecting the sea and its creatures more piously. This group interprets the will of the gods more physically and forcefully, believing themselves called to venture beyond the waters of Waterdeep to fulfill their protective obligation.

### INCITING ADVENTURING INCIDENT

Maeryn’s public presence in Waterdeep causes more talk than the monarchy would like. They prefer the bastard children of Oldron lay low and out of sight. However, Maeryn’s druidic abilities, paired with her tall stature, have attracted more attention recently.
