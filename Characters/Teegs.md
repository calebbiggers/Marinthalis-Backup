# Teegs

![[teegs.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Teegs is a parrot [[Aarakocra]] [[Rogue]] ([[Thief]]) with bright blue and red feathers. Short and nimble, Teegs is a vibrant and energetic presence among the crew. His adventurous spirit is matched only by his mischievous tendencies, always seeking an opportunity for treasure or excitement.

Teegs has spent much of his life as a pirate, honing his skills in thievery and survival. His past is a colorful patchwork of escapades and close calls, but he now finds himself part of a team that values him for more than his cunning. While his roguish instincts remain, Teegs is learning the importance of teamwork and loyalty.
