# Thunder Elementals

![[thunder-elemental.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Forged in the endless storms of the [[Quasi-Elemental Plane of Lightning]], thunder elementals are living echoes of roaring tempests. Their bodies are formed from swirling storm clouds and vibrating shockwaves, their every movement accompanied by a deafening boom. More force than form, they crash into foes like rolling thunder, shattering bones and sending enemies flying with explosive concussive bursts.
