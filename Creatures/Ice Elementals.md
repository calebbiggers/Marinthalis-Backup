# Ice Elementals

![[ice-elemental.png]]
Born from the frozen expanse of the [[Para-Elemental Plane of Ice]], ice elementals are living glaciers shaped by the howling blizzards of their home. Their jagged, crystalline forms shift and crack like calving icebergs, and their presence brings an unnatural chill that seeps into the bones of those who stand against them. Ice elementals strike with the relentless force of an avalanche, encasing foes in frost with every blow. On the Material Plane, they are drawn to places of extreme cold—glacier peaks, frozen lakes, and ancient ruins entombed in permafrost—where they serve powerful frost mages or guard long-buried secrets beneath the ice.
