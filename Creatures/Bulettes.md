# Bulettes

![[bulette.png|float-left|relative|ws-med]]Bulettes (_byoo-LET_), also called “land sharks,” are single-minded predators that burrow under, leap over, and burst through obstacles in pursuit of their quarry. They are sometimes theorized to be a bizarre cross between an armadillo and a snapping turtle, though there was little evidence to support this theory.

 Bulettes burrow rapidly just belowground. On sensing movement, they erupt from below, attempting to catch prey in their oversize maws. Ranging over vast territories, they often threaten animal herds, and can wipe out whole farming communities. While Bulettes can see in perfect darkness with their eyes, its eyes are not a Bulette's primary method of sensory perception. Instead, they typically hunt through the detection of vibrations in the ground, moving towards the source of the movement when their hunger is aroused.

In most cases, a Bulette will swallow its prey whole, also consuming their victim's clothing, weapons, and other equipment. They can in fact successfully digest these tough materials through the use of powerful stomach acid.

## Description

>[!reading]
>”The size of a lion but more powerfully compact, the monster looks like a cross between a hornless rhinoceros and a beetle. Thick gray plates cover the tough leathery skin of its body and extend down all six powerful legs. Its spade-shaped head splits open to reveal a toothy maw.”

Around the head and rear, this armor was a blue-brown color, while in-between the hue might range from gray-blue to blue-green. Areas around the eyes were slightly darkened, with the eyes themselves being a yellow color with blue-green pupils. They have stumpy but powerful leg and a powerful jaw mechanism for snapping up their unsuspecting prey.

## Nesting

Bulettes nest once every 10 years or so. As a part of this process, they create a protective nest out of a special substance they create by combining metal ore, minerals, and a secretion their own bodies. This material is very strong and resilient. Because of this, empty Bulette nests can stand for hundreds of years without degrading. Often times Bulettes reuse the same nests many times in their lifespan, sometimes of their own making and other times nests previously created and used by other Bulettes.
