# Manta-Pseudodragon

![[namielle-image.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]The Manta-Pseudodragon is a subspecies of [[Pseudodragons|Psuedodragons]] thought to have originated in the [[Elemental Plane of Water]]. Instead of flying, they are amphibious creatures who mainly reside in oceans, rivers, and lakes. While Manta-Pseudoragons lack the venomous stingers of their land-based cousins, they instead have developed a special organ called an _Electrocyte_ that allows them to build up and release an electric charge.

Even in the material plane, Manta-Pseudodragon are still attuned to the Plane of Water, allowing them to magically summon water and eject it from their mouths with supernatural force. This high pressure stream of water can cut through solid steel.
