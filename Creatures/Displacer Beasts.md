# Displacer Beasts

![[displacer-beast.png|float-right|relative|ws-med|clear]]A displacer beast resembles a gaunt, six-legged panther with a barbed tentacle sprouting from each of its shoulders. This predator uses innate magic to displace light so it appears to be several feet away from its actual location.

Displacer beasts hunt not just to feed but because they enjoy killing. Once displacer beasts begin stalking prey, they can’t be deterred until either they or their quarry is slain. While displacer beasts commonly inhabit dense forests, they might pursue travelers across great distances and even into cities or dungeons. More cunning than mere animals, these predators might set ambushes or lie hidden for days to bring down their prey.

Displacer beasts sometimes pursue prey through portals to other planes of existence. As a result, these predators can be found across the multiverse, particularly on the worlds of the Material Plane, in the Shadowfell, and in the Feywild. These restless hunters can destroy a land’s natural balance and drive other creatures to extinction. As a result, many druid circles and Fey view displacer beasts as deadly threats.

## Displacer Beast Lore

**Animal Handling DC 15**: While displacer cubs, if trained from an early age, can form amiable bonds with a caretaker, this will not stop them from attacking when bored or irritated, as they often are in the conditions most would-be beastmasters keep them.

**Arcana DC 15**: The violent and well-documented animosity between displacer beasts and blink dogs seems to be rooted in some innate disruptive effect each creature's magical abilities has on the other.

**Arcana DC 20**: Though displacer beasts are primarily pack hunters, the fey coeurl from which they descend is an entirely solitary creature. With all the malice of an ordinary displacer beast and an intellect beyond even that of many humanoids, the coeurl is able to rapidly adapt to changing situations, even able to use complex tools and weapons that it scavenges.

Worse still, it will often pretend to be an ordinary displacer beast to lure unsuspecting poachers that think to claim its hide and eyes, both prized for their use in the creation 
of enchanted armaments.

**History DC 15**: Displacer beasts are vicious to the core, sport hunters that extend the agony of their prey for as long as possible, often waiting until safety is in sight to close for the kill, or even allowing it to escape and then later tracking it to its home, surprising any creature unaware that their spined tentacle pads can deftly open doors and windows.

**Nature DC 10**: Displacer beasts slink through the dense canopies in which they lair, their six legs giving them a remarkable ability to climb and balance, while the 
irridescent black of their fur and natural mastery of illusions leads the eye to simply slide past them as they stalk their prey from above.

**Nature DC 15**: Remarkably intelligent by the standards of wildlife, displacer beasts are able to silently coordinate their attacks through subtle illusory signals, and have been known to use wounded creatures as bait to lure their allies into ambushes.
