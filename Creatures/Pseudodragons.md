# Pseudodragon

![[pseudodragon.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Pseudodragons dwell in scenic wildernesses, preferably where life is easy and prey is small and slow. There they behave like contented wyrms, creating tiny lairs amid ancient trees and rugged cliffs. They fill these lairs with shiny rocks, colorful shells, and unattended treasures that catch their attention, and they guard these hoards fiercely.

Pseudodragons grow to the size of large house cats, and most have red-brown scales. Some have scales with other hues or patterns—markings distinct from those of their larger draconic cousins.

Pseudodragons have little interest in other creatures, and they avoid them whenever possible. If it is attacked, a pseudodragon fights back using the poisonous stinger at the tip of its tail, one jab of which can put a creature into a catatonic state that can last for hours.

Pseudodragons can’t speak, but they communicate using a limited form of telepathy that allows them to share basic ideas such as hunger, curiosity, or affection. When it bonds with a companion, a pseudodragon can communicate what it sees and hears even over long distances. A pseudodragon often vocalizes animal noises. A rasping purr indicates pleasure, while a hiss means unpleasant surprise. A bird-like chirping represents desire, and a growl always means anger or discontent.

Mages often seek out pseudodragons, whose agreeable disposition, telepathic ability, and resistance to magic make them superior familiars. Pseudodragons are selective when it comes to choosing companions, but they can sometimes be won over with gifts of food or treasure. When a pseudodragon finds an agreeable companion, it bonds with that person as long as it is treated fairly. A pseudodragon puts up with no ill treatment, and it abandons a manipulative or abusive companion without warning. Many pseudodragons prefer the finer things in life. These diminutive dragons might be inclined to aid those who ply them with treats. Contrariwise, mages who don’t properly pamper their pseudo dragon familiars might be abandoned without warning.
