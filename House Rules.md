# House Rules

This page shows all the house rules we use in our campaign for reference. These rules are listed in alphabetical order and may be updated over time.

## Counterspell

If [[Counterspell]] is ever used to counter another casting of Counterspell, roll on the [[Wild Magic Sorcery#Wild Magic Surge Table|Wild Magic Surge Table]] with the point of origin being the midpoint between the two spell casters if needed—duplicating effects if required.

## Criticals Hits

When you score a critical hit, do not roll twice for damage. Instead, you deal the max dice damage and then add the damage dice again. If the attack involves other damage dice, such as from the Rogue’s [[Rogue#Level 1 Sneak Attack|Sneak Attack]] feature, you also add full damage for these dice.

>[!dnd] Example
> A Greatsword dealing 2d6 + 3 would instead deal 12 + 2d6 + 3 on a critical hit.

## Drinking & Inebriation

Drinking alcohol is a common pastime and element of many social encounters. However, consuming too much alcohol causes a creature to become [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriated]]. This can be measured in six levels using the following rules. Upon having a drink, a creature must make a Constitution saving throw. The formula for the DC of this save is shown below:

$$\text{DC} = 10 + 2 * \text{Current Inebriation Level}$$

While a creature has at least one level of [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriation]], it gains a bonus to certain [[D20 Tests]] and a penalty to others. The formula for both the bonus and penalties is shown below:

$$\text{Bonus/Penalty} = 2 * \text{Current Inebriation Level}$$

The table below shows the effects of each level of [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriation]]. Both the penalties and benefits are cumulative.

### Inebriation Levels Table

| Level | Penalties                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              | Benefits                                                                |

|   3   | Penalty to Strength [[D20 Tests]], as well as Constitution saving throws made to maintain [[Spells#Concentration\|Concentration]].                                                                                                            | Bonus on any saving throws made against being [[Conditions#Frightened\|Frightened]] or intimidated |
|   4   | Penalty to [[D20 Tests]] for all abilities                                                                                                                                                                                                    | No benefits. Previous benefits no longer apply                          |
|   5   | Upon reaching this level, and upon moving more than half of its speed, the character must make a DC 15 Constitution saving throw. On a failure they either falls [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] or vomit. If the character vomits, they remove 1 level of [[Conditions#Inebriated\|Inebriation]] | -                                                                       |
|   6   | Character falls [[Conditions#Unconscious\|Unconscious]]. Additionally, they must make a DC 15 History check upon waking to remember the events of the last hour                                                                                                       | -                                                                       |

Certain creatures have a tolerance to alcohol that's either natural or practiced. A creature that has [[Damage & Healing#Resistance and Vulnerability|Resistance]] to poison damage or has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on saving throws against being [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on each Constitution saving throw against becoming [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriated]]. A creature immune to poison damage or the [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]] condition can't become [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriated]] against their will. Alternatively, at the GM's discretion, a creature may have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Advantage]] on saves against becoming [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriated]] due to building up a natural tolerance from drinking over time.

For every hour the creature doesn't drink any alcohol, it loses one level of [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriation]], provided it's either [[Conditions#Unconscious|Unconscious]] or has also ingested some food or water.

Finishing a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]] removes any levels of [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriation]] unless the creature fell unconscious for the duration of the rest as a result of suffering the effects of level 6. In that case, the creature loses 1d4 + 2 levels of [[Conditions#Inebriated|Inebriation]] instead and doesn't regain Hit Dice as a result of finishing a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]].

## Flanking

>[!info] Flanking is an optional rule from Fifth Edition 2014 D&D, but was removed in Fifth Edition 2024 D&D. In our campaign, we will be using a modified version of the rule.

A creature is considered “flanked” if the creature has two enemies (of the same size or one size smaller) positioned on opposite sides of it. In order to count as flanking, one must be able to draw a straight line from the center of each flanking creature, through either opposite sides or opposite corners of the flanked creature. **A straight line through one corner to one side is NOT considered flanking.**

![[Flanking.webp|border]]

Creatures that are flanking a creature gain a +2 attack bonus to any attack rolls made against the flanked target.

## Potion Consumption

Consuming any potion yourself is considered a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]] instead of an [[Actions|Action]]. However, for [[Potions of Healing]] you may instead take an Action to drink it or feed it to another creature, with either gaining its full healing benefit.

>[!dnd] Example
> If you take a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]] to drink a [[Potion of Greater Healing]], you roll 4d4+4 to get the amount of hit points gained.
>
> If you instead took an [[Actions|Action]], you gain the full benefit: ie. 4d4+4 = 20 HP
