## Session 26: Winds of Revelation

- The party battled the [[Ice Elementals|Ice Elemental]]. During the fight, [[The Party#Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]] realized she was able to understand the creature as it was speaking Aquan; the language of those native to the [[Elemental Plane of Water]].
- The crew defeated it and then once again attempted to solve the four storms riddle
- The party tried the lightning rune next. The air in the room became charged, lightning began to strike the ground, and a [[Thunder Elementals|Thunder Elemental]] was summoned.
- During the battle, Keiran thought to use the [[Immovable Rod]] as a lightning rod to draw in the random strikes and after several minutes of battle, the Thunder Elemental was defeated as well.
- Taking a short rest, the crew decided to activate the rain rune next, summoning a [[Water Elementals|Water Elemental]].
- After defeating the water elemental, the party activated the air rune, causing both the exit and the path leading further into the temple to open.
- With the way no longer barred, the crew explored further into the temple. The next room seemed to be some sort of inner sanctum of the temple. A statue of [[Talos]] stood overlooking the room, and three almost meditative corpses sat in front of it.
- Inspecting the statue of Talos, [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] discovered the [[Storm Warden's Prayer]] etched into its base.
- Looking at the three bodies the crew discovered:
	- The center corpse, a tiefling, wearing [[Shellguard Armor|shell armor]] and holding a small driftwood box. With [[Zephyr’s Note|a note]] nearby.
	- The left corpse, a human, wearing [[Mistwalker’s Armor|leather armor]] and holding a corked jar.
	- The right corpse, a halfling, also wearing leather armor with [[Animated Shield|a shield]] on its back. This corpse also had a necklace around its neck.
- With the pirate corpses outside the sanctum and the note, the crew deduced that those inside the chamber were [[Groups & Organizations#Storm Wardens|Storm Wardens]] and has sealed themselves inside the temple to escape from the pirates outside.
- Murals on the temple walls depicted what looked like Storm Wardens, collecting small tokens to use as [[Wayfinding Oracle Relics]], similar to the ones Gnar had.
- Gnar activated his Oracle Relics in the middle of the circle of Wardens, causing their relics to join with his. With more relics, the area that the Oracle Relics mapped increased in size.
- Realizing that his mother was a Storm Warden, Gnar had a new idea of why [[NPCs#Edina Drakkar|Edina]] attacked him hometown and kidnapped her.
- Keiran investigated the two potions she received from [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]]. Learning she carried one [[Potion of Comprehension]] and one potion of [[Bottled Talent]].
- After finishing exploring the temple, the crew discussed what to do about their new castaway friend. As a group, they decided to give [[The Party#Kael Resnik|Kael]] passage for now.

## Session 25: A Farewell & a New Journey

- After waking the next morning, the crew decided they wanted to celebrate their victory over [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]]. For the celebration, they wanted to give the town a barrel of brandy as well as a gallon of honey from their [[Alchemy Jug]].
- Travelling back to [[The World of Marinthalis#The Refuge of Kletva|Kletva]] life seemed to be returning to the island. Seabirds were returning, and plants were beginning to grow again.
- Walking through town, the crew saw [[NPCs#Zorin Kornek|Zorin]] going through a burnt out building with his son. Zorin explained that the building used to be his bakery.
- Traveling through town back to the church of [[Selûne]], as they approached the wooden barricades, the front section of the walls came crashing down. [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] and some other townsfolk had begun tearing down their fortifications.
- The group told Vargen of their plan to celebrate and Vargen offered his [[Vargen’s Greataxe|greateaxe]] as a reward for their help instead of this [[Ylar Family Crest Medallion|family crest]].
- With a celebration planned for that evening the crew split up to prepare.
	- [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] and [[The Party#Teegs|Teegs]] went back to the church of Selune to tend to the wounded
	- [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]] went back to Zorin to assist and flirt with him.
	- [[The Party#Lock on an Open Door|Lock]] and [[The Party#Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]] went to the town square to help clean it up for the celebration
- Lock and Keiran managed to fix the obsidian fountain in the town square as well as set up some decorations using Locks knowledge of oragami. Keiran also went to the workshop of the towns deceased blacksmith and found some [[Tools#Smith’s Tools|Smith’s Tools]], two rusted ingots, and a half finished longsword.
- Gnar decided to try to hunt some game to imports Zorin. He was able to catch a peasant which he presented to the cook.
- Shtepi, after healing those he could began to attempt to create prosthetics for those missing limbs
- During the party, Shtepi went off on his own and secretly packed his stuff from the ship.
- The next morning, Shtepi told the crew he had decided to stay in [[The World of Marinthalis#Stygia|Stygia]] and help the people there. Shtepi was able to persuade [[The Party#Namielle (Bubbles)|Namielle]] to stay with the rest of the crew
- The crew, now one member fewer, bid farewell and embarked on their journey once more
- On the second day of sailing, Gnar’s [[Wayfinding Oracle Relics]] began to act peculiarly. A pearl began to glow. The crew decided to sail towards this marker and see what it was.

![[small-island-banner.jpg|border]]
- The crew discovered a [[The World of Marinthalis#A Small Remote Island|small remote island]]. On the beach was a [[The Party#Kael Resnik|marooned sailor]] who introduced himself to the crew as “Kael”.
- While interrogating their new acquaintance, Teegs noticed that there was a large boulder near the middle of the island that looked like tooled stone. When he went to inspect it, he saw that the stone bore faint carvings of storm clouds and lightning bolts.
- As the rest of the crew and Kael caught up, they discovered a narrow staircase carved into the rock, descending into the earth. Following the staircase, the way opened up into a large stone cavern, decorated with more stone motifs.
- This cavern contained the [[Four Storms Puzzle]]. While the party tried to decipher the poem, Kael sent Poe to stand on one of the tiles, causing the way out to close, the air to grow cold, and a giant Ice Elemental to appear.

## Session 24: Her Name is Shirina

 - After seeing how well the crew was able to handle themselves in both battles he witnessed, [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] decided to ask for their assistance one last time. He pulled aside [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] and explained his past.
 - Vargen admitted that he had not been fully forthright with the crew. He explained that northwest of the town, there was a portal. Vargen’s family were the guardians of this portal for years, until a woman emerged from the portal and killed his family. The woman was named [[NPCs#Shirina|Shirina]] and Vargen believed that she was responsible for the shadow plague on the island.
 - Vargen asked Shtepi for the crews help in returning to the portal, and defeating Shirina, as he thought that Shtepi was the leader of the group.
 - Shtepi, predicting that the crew would need some sort of monetary compensation and wanting to help, secretly gave Vargen 200 Gp, with which he could offer to the crew.
 - Vargen then addressed the entire crew and offered, 200 Gp, several trinkets, and his family crest in return for the crews assistance. The crew agreed.
 - Before leaving the town to find Shirina, [[The Party#Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]] stopped by [[NPCs#Aethel Seerclaw|Aethel’s]] tent to get a reading of the future. She predicted good luck for Keiran.
 - The crew and Vargen set out into the forrest to confront Shirina.
 - After some time following Vargen, the crew found a small deserted and ruined home. Vargen explained that it was his family home before Shirina arrived, and that the portal was further into their land.
 - During travel, the crew could hear the faint ringing of bells, which grew louder as they moved through the woods.
 - Continuing deeper into the forrest, the crew arrived at a clearing. Standing in the middle of the glade was a stone archway, glowing with a magical light. To either side was two crystals connected with a magical light.
 - In front of the portal, sitting on top of a throne seemingly made up of countless shadows, was a towering pale elvish woman dressed in green regal garb. Addressing the group, she demanded they bow for they were in the presence of royalty.
 - Several members of the crew complied and bowed.
 - Shirina declared that the island belonged to her and offered for the party to allow her to corrupt them and join her. As the crew attempted to negotiate, Vargen began to shake and foam at the mouth.
 - The crew watched as Vargen revealed himself to be a lycanthrope and transformed into a hybrid-bestial form to attack Shirina.
 - Shirina summoned a massive shadow beast covered in bells to defend herself as shadow creatures began swarm through the portal.
 - The crew quickly figured out to destroy the crystals keeping the portal open and dispatched the smaller shadow creatures.
 - With the help of the crew, Vargen was able to kill Shirina. After which the large shadow beast attacked in a frenzy. After a tough fight, the crew were able to put down the enraged monster.
 - Worried for [[The Party#Namielle (Bubbles)|Namielle]], the crew quickly returned to the ship to look for him.
 - They found Namielle hiding in the crows nest and inspected the ship. The creatures turned shadow monsters had broken out and wreaked havoc on the ships storage.
 - Upon looking in the ships brig, the party found the body of [[NPCs#Borgos Leon|Borgos]], the captured [[Groups & Organizations#The Whisper Pirates|Whisper Pirate]]. While the party was away, the shadow creatures of the island had infiltrated the ship and killed him before possessing the creatures on board.

## Session 23: Under Siege in Darkness

 - Returning to the townsfolk, the group and Vargen began to prepare to distribute the food acquired.
 - Vargen introduced the crew to the cook working at the church to provide food for everyone, [[NPCs#Zorin Kornek|Zorin Kornek]]
 - Several crew members ([[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]], [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]], [[The Party#Lock on an Open Door|Lock]], & [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]]) decided to have a bread baking competition.
 - Gnar made use of his [[Ring of Roses]] to decorate his bread and uses his own body sweat as salt. Quinn decided to have [[Toothy - The Trusty Mimic|Toothy]] help him with his bread (Toothy ate most of the dough). Shtepi requested herbs and spices from [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] that he used for his bread. Vargen judged the competition and declared Shtepi as the winner.
 - As everyone was eating, the town scout, [[NPCs#Darin Shadowstalk|Darin Shadowstalk]], returned to the church refuge calling for [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]].
 - Darin hastily explained that they’d seen the various shadow creatures congregating in the forest and that they suspected an impending attack.
 - The crew began preparations to defend what was left of the town. Creating pit traps, laying down oil for fire barriers, repairing any holes in the wooden wall surrounding the church, and preparing the few able-bodied townsfolk left to defend themselves.
 - As night approached, a magical darkness encroached on the wall surrounding the church. Those, outside of the church could hear the sound of many creatures running towards the wall.
 - Several large creatures appeared from the darkness, all of them corrupted by shadows: a manticore, a chimera, an owlbear, and a cockatrice. The crew members realized that these were the creatures they had rescued from [[NPCs#Lord Percival Von Goldfellow|Lord Goldfellow’s]] estate.
 - Vargen and the crew fought off the shadow-infected creatures, and a horde of shadow ghouls. They managed to protect the town with minimal casualties; only losing one townsperson in the attack.
 - The crew members realized that if the monsters has broken out of the ship, they did not know what happened to [[The Party#Namielle (Bubbles)|Bubbles]] and [[NPCs#Borgos Leon|Borgos]], who they also left on the ship.

## Session 22: An Incurable Plague

 - The party continued forward towards the town, entering and making their way towards the barricades surrounding the church.
 - After knocking on the large makeshift door, the party was introduced to [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]], the current leader of what was left of the town. Vargen, knowing how dangerous the rest of the island was, asked the crew how they managed to survive their journey.
 - They explained that they had fought off several shadow creatures and [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] revealed his leg wound, which greatly surprised Vargen.
 - Vargen welcomed the party within the wooden walls, introduced himself, and explained that the island was under the effects of something he called a “Shadow Plague”.
 - As he led the party through the makeshift encampment surrounding the church, Vargen described how the shadow plague has slowly increased in severity over the years, to the point where the remaining townspeople had to sequester into this makeshift encampment around the temple of [[Selûne]] in the town.
 - Entering the temple, Vargen introduced the crew to the temple priestess, [[NPCs#Elda Moonglade|Elda Moonlade]].He then asked the crew for help in forming a search party for several members of the encampment who has been sent out to get supplies the previous day. They had not returned.
 - Vargen got Shtepi alone to interrogate him about his injury; explaining that he had never seen anyone resist turning from a shadow ghoul bite for several minutes, let alone several years. Vargen agreed to help heal Shtepi’s leg if the crew helped him search for his townsfolk.
 - While the rest of the crew took some time to rest, [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar]], [[The Party#Lock on an Open Door|Lock]], and [[The Party#Teegs|Teegs]] went to visit [[NPCs#Aethel Seerclaw|an owlin]] that Gnar had seen shuffling cards on the way into the church.
 - The owlin introduced herself as Aethel Seerclaw—a fortune teller—and performed [[Aethel’s Tarot Readings]] for the three crew members. Gnar and Lock gave her some ale and a ration as thanks.
 - After a short rest, Vargen and the crew ventured outside the walls to search for the missing townsfolk. They headed to the Northeast of the temple, to an area of farmland just outside the town.
 - At a fork in the road, with one path leading to a barn, the crew found an empty toppled cart as well as the corpse of an oxe that appeared to have been pulling the cart. Strangely the oxe’s head was missing.
 - Vargen went ahead to inspect the barn while the rest of the crew began investigating the cart.
 - While this was happening, [[The Party#Lock on an Open Door|Lock]] and [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] began to walk into the surrounding fields, seemingly in a trance.
 - As the other crew members tried to stop Lock and Quinn, a spectral centaur-like creature appeared, charging down the road at the crew. It appeared to be wearing the ox head.
 - In the ensuing battle, [[The Party#Vargen Ylar|Vargen]] and the crew fought the headless horseman and several possessed scarecrows that had put Lock and Quinn in a trance.
 - After defeating the creatures, the crew began to search for survivors. They found [[NPCs#Jared Flint|Jared Flint]], one of the few fighters left in the town who Vargen sent out to accompany the trip to get provisions.
 - On the way back to the town, [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] discovered that the two [[Potion of Healing|Potions of Greater Healing]] he had is his pack were missing. Upon investigating, he realized that [[Toothy - The Trusty Mimic|Toothy]], the mimic he stole from [[NPCs#Master Elrikor Galanodel|Elrikor]] was in his pack and it had eaten his potions, one of his daggers, and his [[Cloak of the Manta Ray]].

## Session 21: A Colorless Island

- Continuing along a path leading inland, the crew began exploring this island. The path seemed to be unkept as if it hadn’t been used in a while. After about 30 minutes of walking, the crew noticed a pillar of smoke in the distance.
- [[The Party#Teegs|Teegs]] noticed that [[The Party#Keiran Thalassa|Keiran’s]] shadow didn’t match her movements for a split second.
- After noticing this discrepancy in Keiran’s shadow, Teeg’s began to relay what he saw to the other members of the crew, starting with [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]]. Using the [[Light]] spell, Quinn threw his dagger at Keiran’s shadow. Upon sticking the shadow, Keiran’s shadow stopped following her, as if pinned to the ground.
- The shadow let out an ear-piercing screech and the party was ambushed by 3 other shadow creatures.
- In the ensuing battle, [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] was possessed by a shadow creature and was forced to attack the rest of the crew with [[Lightning Bolt]].
- Throughout the fight, the shadows seemed to be sapping the strength from those that were attacked, with Keiran succumbing to weakness and dying in the battle.
- After clearing the rest of the shadows, [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] rushed to Keiran’s body, and cast [[Revivify]] in order to revive her, using the diamonds the crew stole from [[NPCs#Yaw’goo Bhagar|Yaw’goo’s]] ship.
- After regrouping and healing, [[The Party#Teegs|Teegs]] flew up into the sky to scout out the area ahead to try to see the source of the smoke.
- Looking to find the source, Teegs saw the remains of a small town. Within the town, there was a large bonfire burning next to some sort of church. The church was located on top of a hill, with the entire hill surrounded by a makeshift wooden wall.

## Session 20: Entering the Tempest

- Two members of the crew locked [[NPCs#Yaw’goo Bhagar|Yaw'goo]] and the other pirate in the ship's brig while the others attempted to clean off the dock to hide the evidence of combat.
- An Isleguard member doing his nightly patrol stumbled upon the two ships. After some convincing the guard urged them to move along.
- [[The Party#Keiran Thalassa|Keiran]] and [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] decided to stay on board Yaw'goo's ship ***[[Vessels & Vehicles#Iron Tide|Iron Tide]]*** and searched the place, pretending to be readying the ship to leave.
- The rest of the crew sailed away and stayed nearby in the harbor.
- Searching several rooms in the ship, Keiran and Quinn found:
	- A Lockbox
	- Maps
	- Gunpowder barrels
	- Spice barrels
- Escaping from the back of ***The Iron Tide*** (but not before Quinn tripped and spilled half the gunpowder), they both walked across the harbor back to ***[[Vessels & Vehicles#Peggy Lou (Previously The Sea Ghost)|Peggy Lou]]*** using the spell [[Water Walk]].
- [[The Party#Teegs|Teegs]] managed to open the lockbox, finding several shipping documents (both real and forged) as well as 5 diamonds.
- [[The Party#Lock on an Open Door|Lock]] looked at the map and discovered that the map showed the 2 capital cities within the tempest: [[The World of Marinthalis#The City of Neverwinter|Neverwinter]] and [[The World of Marinthalis#Waterdeep|Waterdeep]], but the map also showed various other islands, all linked with some strange arcane symbols.
- Shtepi investigated one of the random potions that the crew stole from [[NPCs#Master Elrikor Galanodel|Elrikor’s]] tower. The potion turned out to be an [[Alchemimic]].
- Upon returning, the crew decided to interrogate both prisoners: Yaw’goo and a pirate named [[NPCs#Borgos Leon|Borgos]]. Borgos gave up all he knew about [[NPCs#Edina Drakkar|Edina]] in return for his life.
- Borgos told the crew that The Whisper Pirates’ base of operations is an island called [[The World of Marinthalis#Drakefang Island|Drakefang Island]], though he himself had never been there.
- After a short and fruitless interrogation, Gnar killed Yaw’goo and fashioned shoulder armor out of the remains of his shell.
- After finishing up the interrogations, the crew decided to venture into the Tempest, each for their own goals.
- The crew navigated into the [[The World of Marinthalis#The Entrance to the Wild Tempest|The Entrance to Tempest]], passing through the large statues marking the way. Upon entering the Tempest, Gnar once again recited [[Storm Warden's Prayer|Storm Warden's Prayer]].
- Once they entered the storm, [[The Party#Gnar Rosewater|Gnar’s]] pouch holding his [[Wayfinding Oracle Relics]] began to glow. After dumping out his pouch, the various rocks, sticks, and shells within seemed to form into some sort of magical map showing their location within the storm.
- Using this newfound ability, Gnar pointed the ship towards the nearest destination.
- During the journey, [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi’s]] injury began to cause a searing pain in his leg. Upon inspecting the injury, the shadowy wound seemed to have spread, covering most of his leg around the knee.
- Shtepi’s shoulder Pauldron that he wears as a cleric of Oghma began to glow. As it began to glow, the pain subsided and the wound appreared to shrink back to normal size. Shtepi’s pauldron had been blessed by Oghma, transforming it into [[Field Healer's Pauldron]].
- After some uneventful sailing for several days, the crew spotted an island on the horizon. As they approached, the air and sea seemed to turn colorless, bland, and quiet.
- Once the ship was closer, [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] recognized the island as the island of [[The World of Marinthalis#Stygia|Stygia]], where he had obtained his mysterious injury some years before.
- The crew docked their ship at a small port they discovered along the coast. The dock seemed to be deserted. The atmosphere had grown even more dreary as they had approached, reaching an apex upon making landfall.
- Upon investigating, the crew found signs up struggle, gashed in the environment, and evidence of blood. However, the crew found no bodies.
- In the dock-house, the crew found some odd shadowy residue. The residue seemed to react to magical light.

## Session 19: Confronting the Whisper Pirates

- To escape the commotion, the crew sailed from Baldur's Gate to lay low on the open ocean. Storing several of the stolen creatures in their ship, including:
	- The cockatrice
	- One owlbear
	- The chimera
	- The manticore
- Reunited with his fellow pseudo-dragons, [[The Party#Namielle (Bubbles)|Namielle]] celebrated with them before the two left. Namielle decided to stay with the crew and join them on their adventures as he had formed a mental bond with Shtepi.
- While the crew is away from Baldur's Gate, Gnar had another vision. This vision continues where the last one left off where Gnar moved through a tempest until he reached a fog wall. This time the silhouette figure was shown to be his mother calling out to him. She implored him to explore the Wild Tempest and find her.
- The crew returned to Baldur's Gate the next day, the 25th of Hammer. The Whisper Pirates' meeting was at midnight.
- In preparation the crew split up:
	- Keiran visited her Otto to get her her prototype pistol back and say goodbye to her family. At her childhood home, Otto gave her a note that was dropped off by a member of the Isleguard as well as an improved pistol. Worried about his younger sister, [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] also decided to tag along with the crew on their journey.
	- Gnar and Shtepi met with the dock master to pay their docking fee. The dock master reveals that they are now wanted criminals and uses this to get a much higher fee for his discretion.
	- The rest of the crew painted the ship to disguise it and officially renamed the ship ***[[Vessels & Vehicles#Peggy Lou (Previously The Sea Ghost)|Peggy Lou]]***
- After some deliberation, Keiran showed Gnar the note. [[Athair's Message to Gnar|The note]] was from Gnar's sister, Athair.
- The crew waited until midnight and arrived at the Sturgeon Lane docks. There they met several pirates unloading cargo. Gnar recognized [[NPCs#Yaw’goo Bhagar|Yaw'goo]] as one of the pirates in the group.
- The crew attacked the pirates, killing everyone except Yaw'goo (who retreated into his shell) and one other pirate.
- During the battle, Keiran attempted to use the [[Iron Bands of Bilarro|iron bands]] given to them by [[NPCs#Master Elrikor Galanodel|Elrikor]]. The bands were revealed to have been a fake.

## Session 18: Crashing an Auction Party

- In the chaos of the escaped creatures wreaking havoc on the city, the crew learned that [[NPCs#Lord Percival Von Goldfellow|Lord Goldfellow]] (The buyer to whom [[The Party#Namielle (Bubbles)|Namielle]] was being smuggled) was hosting an auction party at his estate where he would be selling various exotic creatures.
- Lord Goldfellow's estate was located in [[The World of Marinthalis#Manorborne|Manorborne]], a wealthy neighborhood in [[The World of Marinthalis#The Upper City|The Upper City]]. In order to disguise themselves, the crew visited [[The World of Marinthalis#Enchanted Elegance|Enchanted Elegance]], a fancy boutique in the Upper City.
- Posing as Namielle's handlers, the crew tricked their way into the auction party and began to search for Lord Goldfellow.
- The party was hosted on Lord Goldfellow's property with a mingling area and an auction stage. Behind the stage, the crew found a barn-type building containing all the creatures up for auction:
	- One wyvern
	- Two owlbears
	- One cockatrice
	- One chimera
	- One manticore
	- Two manta-pseudodragons
- All of the creatures were wearing peculiar collars, seemingly making them docile. The manta-pseudodragons however, were stored in two of three large glass boxes filled with water. The crew caused a commotion in the barn by having Namielle go crazy.
- In the commotion, the crew were confronted by Lord Goldfellow who commanded all the creatures to attack them. In the fight, the crew broke the control collars of the wyvern and an owlbear which knocked the creatures unconscious.
- The crew figured out that Lord Goldfellow's headband was what was allowing him to control the creatures, so they chased him down and took it from him. The creatures wreaked havoc on the partygoers, killing several, injuring many, and destroying the property.
- As revenge for Namielle, the crew "pegged" Lord Goldfellow and left him for dead. Lock, using the control headband, got the remaining creatures back to the ship and the rest of the crew blended into the panicked crowd.

## Session 17: Beasts in the Streets

- The next day, while walking along the docks of the Grey Harbor, the crew found a shipment of exotic beasts being transported on the streets: a chimera and a girallon.
- The crew watched as the sedated creatures were moved within cages. Shtepi threw a pebble at the sleeping chimera which woke up the beast. The enraged chimera broke out of its cage and chaos ensued.
- The crew helped to fight off the escaped creatures and are assisted by the Isleguard and a large dire wolf. The girallon is killed in the battle and the chimera managed to fly off and escape.
- After the battle, the dire wolf is revealed to be a shape-shifted [[NPCs#Captain Athair Rosewater|Captain Rosewater]]—Gnar's long lost sister.
- Upon reuniting, Captain Rosewater invited Gnar and his friends back the [[The World of Marinthalis#Isleguard Keep|Isleguard Keep]] to catch up.
- She was shocked and appalled to find out that Gnar had become a pirate, because of their family's history. She asked Gnar to reconsider and sent him away in anger when he refused.
- After this sad reunion, Gnar and the crew headed to a local magical tattoo shop, [[The World of Marinthalis#Ink & Arcana|Ink & Arcana]]. The shop was run by [[NPCs#Melnir Swiftcarver|Melnir Swiftcarver]], and several crew members bought tattoos:
	- Shtepi got a [[Darksight Tattoo|tatto of an eye]] to let him see in the dark
	- Gnar got a [[Kraken's Maw Tattoo|tattoo of a kraken's mouth]] on his neck that allowed him to frighten enemies.
	- Keiran got a [[Lucky Sparrow Tattoo|tattoo to improve her luck]]
	- Lock got a tattoo on his tail that made it more dexterous.
	- The entire crew got matching tattoos of a severed leg - after their namesake as "The Peggers"

## Session 16: Confronting a Wizard

- The party confronted travelled back to Elrikors tower. Upon reaching the front door, they discovered that the friendly door mimic that they had seen earlier, was now hostile.
- After defeating the doorway mimic, the crew climbed the tower to confront Elrikors. In the battle, Elrikor died and his tower went up in flames.
- Before leaving, [[The Party#Quinn Thalassa|Quinn]] picked up a [[Toothy - The Trusty Mimic|tamed mimic]] Elrikor was using as a shield. [[The Party#Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] picked up 3 unknown potions from what was left of Elrikors lab.
- In the chaos of the tower burning down, the crew slipped away back to their ship under the cover of night.

## Session 15: Peculiar Mimic Activity

- After raiding the tomb, the crew continued exploring the mines. As they got deeper and deeper, they began to find more and more gashes in the stone walls.
- Nearing the end of the mine, the crew found a large open space littered with corpses of what seemed to be adventurers and mercenaries.
- Shtepi noticed that one of the corpses appeared oddly textured and shaped. As he prodded it, the crews torches began to extinguish seemingly on their own. Once the last torch was out, the crew was attacked by an unknown creature in the darkness.
- Quickly relighting a torch, the crew discovered that the peculiar body had moved. In the ensuing battle the crew figured out that the corpse was a unknown form of mimic that upon being perceived in any way, would transform into a corpse, and otherwise was a large monstrous creature.
- The crew cleverly came up with a plan to switch off attacking the creature and looking at it to lock it in place. This plan succeeded and they killed the mimic. As it died they noticed that the mimic seemed to be stitched together as if it was some sort of engineered monstrosity. The creature had a similar arcane symbol to the door mimic on its body.
- The players suspected Elrikor to be behind the creation of this monster and that he had set them up to die as an experiment - like all the other adventurers whos corpses littered the cave.

## Session 14: Into the Mines

- The crew returned the cat to the child. They refused the small amount of payment the child offered.
- Gnar wanted to investigate why the wanted posters had his name on them, so he visited [[The World of Marinthalis#Isleguard Keep|Islguard Keep]], the headquarters of [[Groups & Organizations#The Isleguard|The Isleguard]]. There he discovered that there was a halfling Isleguard Captain with the last name "Rosewater". She was not around so he decided to return later.
- Following up on the other notice board quest, the crew travelled to [[The World of Marinthalis#Master Elrikor's Tower|Master Elrikor's Tower]], a tall structure in the lower city. Upon arriving the group was met by a peculiar door. After knocking, the door was revealed to be some sort of mimic under the control of Elrikor.
