## DM Notes

### Intro

>[!quote] As your party meanders through the cobbled streets of the city, a quaint brick building catches their attention. The sign above the sturdy wooden door reads "The Cracked Mug" The exterior is unassuming, the worn bricks blending with the surrounding structures. A flickering lantern hangs by the entrance, casting a warm glow on the weathered sign.

>[!quote] Upon entering, the scent of aged spirits envelops the air. The interior boasts a rustic charm, with heavy wooden beams supporting the low ceiling. A scattering of worn, mismatched tables and chairs fill the main room, and a large stone hearth crackles with a comforting fire.
