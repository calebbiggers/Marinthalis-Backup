# Doors

Adventurers interact with doors often in a D&D campaign. This section gives rules for most of the doors the adventurers encounter.

## Common Doors

The Doors table provides the AC and Hit Points for common doors, which are Medium objects.

With the [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action, a creature can try to force open a door that is barred or locked, doing so with a successful Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check. The table provides the DC of the check. For bigger doors, double or triple the Hit Points and increase the DC of the check by 5.

### Doors Table

|    Door     | AC  | HP  | DC to Open |
|:-----------:|:---:|:---:|:----------:|
| Glass door  | 13  |  4  |     10     |
| Metal door  | 19  | 72  |     25     |
| Stone door  | 17  | 40  |     20     |
| Wooden door | 15  | 18  |     15     |

### Barred Door

A barred door has no lock. A creature on the barred side of the door can take the [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action to lift the bar from its braces, allowing the door to be opened.

### Locked Door

Characters who don’t have the key to a locked door can try to pick the lock using [[Tools#Thieves’ Tools\|Thieves’ Tools]]. The Lock Complexity table tells you how long it takes to try to pick a lock based on its complexity. At the end of that time, the character picks the lock by making a successful Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Sleight of Hand]]) check using Thieves’ Tools. The DC is determined by the lock’s quality, as shown in the Lock Quality table.

## Lock Complexity Table

| Complexity |   Time   |
|:----------:|:--------:|
|   Simple   | 1 action |
|  Complex   | 1 minute |

## Lock Quality Table

| Quality  | DC to Unlock |
|:--------:|:------------:|
| Inferior |      10      |
|   Good   |      15      |
| Superior |      20      |

## Secret Doors

A secret door is crafted to blend into the wall that surrounds it. Sometimes faint cracks in the wall or scuff marks on the floor betray the secret door’s presence. Other than the fact that it’s hidden, a secret door is similar to a common door.

With the [[Actions#Search\|Search]] action, a character can search for a secret door along a 10-foot-square section of wall and make a Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]]) check. On a successful check, the character finds any secret door hidden in that section of wall as well as the mechanism to open the door. The DC of the check depends on how well the secret door is hidden, as shown in the Secret Doors table.

You can instead call for an Intelligence ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Investigation]]) check if the challenge involves deducing that a door is present from noticeable clues, rather than spotting those clues in the first place. See “[[Proficiency#Skill List\|Perception]]” in [[chapter 2]] for more advice.

### Secret Doors Table

|        Secret Door        | DC to Detect |
|:-------------------------:|:------------:|
| Barely hidden secret door |      10      |
|   Standard secret door    |      15      |
|  Well-hidden secret door  |      20      |

### Secret Door Etiquette

Adventurers often fail to locate secret doors. For this reason, don’t hide important treasures or locations behind secret doors unless you’re comfortable with the characters not finding them, and don’t risk letting your adventure grind to a halt because the only path forward is hidden behind a secret door.

## Portcullises

Typically made of iron or wood, a portcullis blocks a passage or an archway until it is raised into the ceiling by a winch and chain. Creatures within 5 feet of a lowered portcullis can make ranged attacks or cast spells through it, and they have [[Combat#Three-Quarters Cover\|Three-Quarters Cover]] against attacks, spells, and other effects originating from the opposite side. A portcullis can also be attacked and destroyed, using the AC and Hit Points of a metal door (if iron) or a wooden door (if wood).

Winching a portcullis up or down requires the Utilize action. If a creature can’t reach the winch (usually because it’s on the other side of the portcullis), lifting the portcullis requires the [[Actions#Utilize\|Utilize]] action and a successful Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check. The DC of the check depends on the type of portcullis, as shown in the Portcullises table.

### Portcullises Table

|          Portcullis Size          | Iron DC | Wood DC |
|:---------------------------------:|:-------:|:-------:|
| Medium (8 ft. tall × 5 ft. wide)  |   20    |   15    |
| Large (10 ft. tall × 10 ft. wide) |   25    |   20    |
| Huge (20 ft. tall × 15 ft. wide)  |   30    |   25    |
