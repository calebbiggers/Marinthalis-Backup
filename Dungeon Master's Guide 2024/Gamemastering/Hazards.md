# Hazards

The [[Player’s Handbook]] describes common hazards that adventurers encounter, such as [[falling]] and [[Exploration#Dehydration\|Dehydration]]. This section details some more unusual hazards you can add to a location to make it more challenging.

## Severity and Level

Each hazard in this section is designated as a nuisance or as deadly for characters of certain levels. A nuisance hazard is unlikely to seriously harm characters of the indicated levels, whereas a deadly hazard can grievously damage characters of the indicated levels.

Use caution when introducing a hazard to characters of a level lower than the hazard’s level range. A hazard that is a nuisance at one level range could be deadly to characters in the next-lower range.

## Example Hazards

### Brown Mold

_Deadly Hazard (Levels 5–10) or Nuisance Hazard (Levels 11–16)_

Brown mold resembles a furry, light-brown carpet. This fungus feeds on warmth, drawing heat from anything around itself. One patch of brown mold covers a 10-foot square, and the temperature within 30 feet of it is always frigid.

When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the mold for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the creature makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 22 (4d10) Cold damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one.

Brown mold has [[Damage & Healing#Immunity\|Immunity]] to Fire damage, and any source of fire brought within 5 feet of it causes the mold to instantly expand across a surface and toward the fire, creating a new patch that covers a 10-foot square. A patch of brown mold exposed to an effect that deals any amount of Cold damage is destroyed instantly.

### Fireball Fungus

_Deadly Hazard (Levels 5–10)_

A fireball fungus is a Small, inanimate mushroom that can grow anywhere fungi are found in abundance. Its luminous, orange cap sheds [[Exploration#Bright Light\|Bright Light]] in a 15-foot radius and [[Exploration#Dim Light\|Dim Light]] for an additional 15 feet.

A fireball fungus has AC 10, HP 6, and [[Damage & Healing#Immunity\|Immunity]] to Psychic damage. When it drops to 0 Hit Points, the fungus explodes as if a [[Fireball]] spell (save DC 15) had been centered on it.

**_At Higher Levels._** The explosion of a fireball fungus causes other fireball fungi in the area of effect to explode as well. You can scale the hazard for higher levels by adding one additional fungus at levels 11–16 or three additional fungi at levels 17–20.

### Green Slime

![[green-slime.png]]
_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

Acidic green slime devours flesh, organic material, and metal on contact. Bright green, wet, and sticky, it clings to walls, floors, and ceilings in patches.

One patch of green slime covers a 5-foot square. Green slime has [[Exploration#Blindsight\|Blindsight]] with a range of 30 feet, and it drops from walls and ceilings when it detects movement below itself. Beyond that, it can’t move. A creature aware of the slime’s presence can avoid being struck by it with a successful DC 10 Dexterity saving throw.

A creature that comes in contact with green slime takes 5 (1d10) Acid damage. The creature takes the damage again at the start of each of its turns until the slime is scraped off (requiring an action) or destroyed. Against wood or metal, green slime deals 11 (2d10) Acid damage each round, and any nonmagical wood or metal item used to scrape off the green slime is destroyed.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Cold, Fire, or Radiant damage destroys a patch of green slime.

### Inferno

_Deadly Hazard (Levels 5–10) or Nuisance Hazard (Levels 11–16)_

Whenever an uncontrolled fire spreads, it can create an inferno that quickly engulfs creatures, objects, and vegetation.

An inferno consists of at least four contiguous 10-foot [[Cubes]] of fire. Each of the inferno’s 10-foot Cubes can be doused with 10 gallons of water. Exposure to a strong wind for 1 minute causes the inferno to grow, adding 1d4 new 10-foot Cubes to its volume. An inferno deprived of fuel burns itself out after 1d10 minutes.

An inferno damages any vegetation or object that isn’t being worn or carried that it touches, dealing 22 (4d10) Fire damage immediately and again at the end of each minute. Any creature that enters the inferno for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there takes 22 (4d10) Fire damage and is burning.

---

### Poisonous Gas

_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

Poisonous gas is usually encountered in an enclosed space, such as a sewer or sealed tomb. The gas fills as much space as it can, up to a maximum of ten 10-foot [[Cubes]]. The transparent gas carries a foul odor. The gas is continuously or periodically replenished by some natural or magical source, though a strong wind disperses the gas for 1 minute.

Any creature that enters poisonous gas for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there makes a DC 12 Constitution saving throw, taking 5 (1d10) Poison damage on a failed save or half as much damage on a successful one. Creatures in the gas also have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Disadvantage]] on [[Damage & Healing#Death Saving Throws\|Death Saving Throws]].

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Poison damage and the save DC, as shown in the following table.

|Levels|Poison Damage|Save DC|
|---|---|---|
|5–10|11 (2d10)|14|
|11–16|22 (4d10)|16|
|17–20|55 (10d10)|18|

### Quicksand Pit

_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

A quicksand pit is 10 feet deep and covers the ground in a 10-foot square. A creature that enters the area sinks 1d4 + 1 feet into the quicksand and has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition. At the start of each of the creature’s turns, it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn’t completely submerged in quicksand, it can take an action to try to escape, doing so with a successful Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check (DC 10 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand). A creature that is completely submerged in quicksand has [[Combat#Total Cover\|Total Cover]] and the [[Conditions#Blinded\|Blinded]] condition and risks suffocation.

A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by taking an action and succeeding on a Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check (DC 5 plus the number of feet the creature has sunk into the quicksand).

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale this hazard for higher levels by making the pit deeper and increasing the number of feet a creature sinks at the start of each of its turns, as shown in the following table.

|Levels|Pit Depth|Sinking Rate|
|---|---|---|
|5–10|15 feet|1d6 feet|
|11–16|20 feet|1d8 feet|
|17–20|30 feet|1d10 feet|

### Razorvine

_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

Razorvine is a plant that grows in wild tangles and hedges. It also clings to the sides of buildings and other surfaces as ivy does. A 10-foot-high, 10-foot-wide, 5-foot-thick wall or hedge of razorvine has AC 11; HP 25; and [[Damage & Healing#Immunity\|Immunity]] to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage.

When a creature comes into contact with razorvine for the first time on a turn, the creature must succeed on a DC 10 Dexterity saving throw or take 5 (1d10) Slashing damage from the bladelike thorns.

---

### River Styx

_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 11–16)_

The [[River Styx]] courses through the Lower Planes. Tasting or touching its waters can shatter a creature’s intellect and personality, as well as strip away its memories. Certain Fiends are immune to the river’s effects.

Unless immune to the river’s effects, a creature that drinks from the Styx, enters the river, or starts its turn in the river makes a DC 20 Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 19 (3d12) Psychic damage and can’t cast spells or take the [[Actions#Magic\|Magic]] action for 30 days. An affected creature can drink from the Styx and swim in its waters without suffering any additional effects.

The effect can be ended only by the [[Greater Restoration]], [[Heal]], or [[Wish]] spell. If the effect isn’t ended after 30 days, the effect becomes permanent and the creature loses all its memories. At that point, nothing short of a [[Wish]] spell or divine intervention can undo the effect.

Water taken from the River Styx loses its potency after 24 hours, becoming a harmless, foul-tasting liquid. Arcanaloths, night hags, and other fell creatures might know rituals that can prolong the water’s potency, at your discretion.

---

### Rockslide

_Deadly Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

When a rockslide occurs, every creature in its path makes a DC 15 Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 11 (2d10) Bludgeoning damage, has the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition, and moves with the rockslide. On a successful save, a creature takes half as much damage only.

When the rockslide stops, its space becomes [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]], and all Prone creatures in its space are buried under rocks and debris. A creature buried in this way has the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition and has [[Combat#Total Cover\|Total Cover]]. As an action, a creature can try to crawl out from under the rock pile. If the creature succeeds on a DC 15 Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) check, it is no longer Restrained; instead, it has the [[Conditions#Prone\|Prone]] condition and is atop the rock pile. If the check fails, the creature remains buried and gains 1 [[Conditions#Exhaustion\|Exhaustion]] level.

A creature that has neither the Incapacitated nor the Restrained condition can spend 1 minute freeing another creature buried by the rockslide.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale this hazard for higher levels by increasing the Bludgeoning damage as follows: 22 (4d10) at levels 5–10, 55 (10d10) at levels 11–16, and 99 (18d10) at levels 17–20.

### Vicious Vine

_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

Vicious vines are animated by magic. They often cling to doorways, archways, walls, and statuary. Until a vicious vine moves, there’s nothing to distinguish it from an inanimate vine.

Each vicious vine has AC 11; HP 16; and Immunity to Bludgeoning, Piercing, and Psychic damage. When a creature enters a space within 5 feet of the vine for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, the vine tries to coil around that creature. The target must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Grappled\|Grappled]] condition (escape DC 12). While Grappled in this way, the target takes 5 (1d10) Necrotic damage from the vine’s life-draining thorns at the start of each of the target’s turns. The vine can grapple only one creature at a time.

As an [[Actions#Influence\|Influence]] action, a character under the effect of a [[Speak with Plants]] spell or similar magic can try to persuade the vine to release its victim, doing so with a successful DC 10 Charisma ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Persuasion]]) check. A creature released by the vine in this way won’t be attacked by that vine again for the next 24 hours.

**_At Higher Levels._** You can scale the hazard for higher levels by increasing the Necrotic damage, the save DC, and the escape DC, as shown in the following table.

|Levels|Necrotic Damage|Save/Escape DC|
|---|---|---|
|5–10|11 (2d10)|14|
|11–16|22 (4d10)|16|
|17–20|55 (10d10)|18|

### Webs

![[web.png]]
_Nuisance Hazard (Levels 1–4)_

Giant spiders weave thick, sticky webs across passages and at the bottom of pits to snare prey. These web-filled areas are [[Combat#Difficult Terrain\|Difficult Terrain]].

A creature that enters a web-filled area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there must succeed on a DC 12 Dexterity saving throw or have the [[Conditions#Restrained\|Restrained]] condition. As an action, a creature Restrained by the webs can try to escape from them, doing so with a successful DC 12 Strength ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Athletics ]]) or Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List\|Acrobatics]]) check.

Each 10-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]] of webs has AC 10; HP 15; Vulnerability to Fire damage; and Immunity to Piercing, Poison, and Psychic damage.

---

### Yellow Mold

_Deadly Hazard (Levels 1–4) or Nuisance Hazard (Levels 5–10)_

Yellow mold grows in dark places, and one patch covers a 5-foot square. If touched, the mold ejects a cloud of spores that fills a 10-foot [[Spells#Cube\|Cube]]. Any creature in that area must succeed on a DC 15 Constitution saving throw or take 11 (2d10) Poison damage and have the [[Conditions#Poisoned\|Poisoned]] condition for 1 minute. While Poisoned in this way, the creature takes 5 (1d10) Poison damage at the start of each of its turns. The creature repeats the save at the end of each of its turns, ending the effect on itself on a success.

Direct sunlight or any amount of Fire damage destroys a patch of yellow mold.
