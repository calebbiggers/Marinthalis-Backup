## Summary

Isaola is a small island. It mostly contains halfling fishing villages. It is the home island of [[Gnar Rosewater]]. Halflings are traditionally peaceful people. However, Isoala has been an exception to the norm. They fight back when raiders and pirates try to siege their village. They value family and friendships. They love good seafood and lots of ale.
