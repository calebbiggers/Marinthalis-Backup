# Dragon Turtle's Rest

Dragon Turtleâ€™s Rest is a small island near [[Baldur's Gate]]. It is a place where pirates are welcome and is kind of a refuge for them. The island gets its name from the large skeleton of a lion turtle covering the island.

The city of [[Canalla]] is the main settlement on the small island.
