# Stygia

Stygia is a small volcanic island located within [[#The Wild Tempest]]. The island is characterized by its dense forests, fertile farmlands, and a towering black mountain at its center. Historically, Stygia was known for exporting obsidian mined from the island. However, the island was slowly taken over by a mysterious shadow-plague from 1486 PT to 1492 PT. The once-thriving community struggled to survive amidst the devastation caused by this affliction. During the first year of the plague, [[Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]] was sent here as a [[Clerics of Ohgma|Cleric of Ohgma]] to help the defense efforts.

# Story

In 1492 PT, The [[Groups/The Pegging Pirates]] arrived in Kletva after entering [[The Wild Tempest]]. A member of the crew, [[Irej Shtepi|Shtepi]], had been to the island before as it was where he received his magical injury.
