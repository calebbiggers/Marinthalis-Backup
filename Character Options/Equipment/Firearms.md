Firearms are a new and volatile technology in the world of Marinthalis, and as such bring their own unique set of weapon properties. Some properties are followed by a number, and this number signifies an element of that property (outlined below).

The Firearms tables in this section shows the firearms for our game. The table lists the cost and weight of each weapon, as well as the following details:

**Damage.** The table lists the amount of damage a weapon deals when an attacker hits with it as well as the type of that damage.

**Properties.** Any properties a weapon has are listed in the Properties column. Each property is defined in the [[#Firearm Properties]] section.

**Mastery.** Each weapon has a mastery property, which is defined in the [[Weapons#Mastery Properties|Mastery Properties]] section. To use that property, you must have a feature that lets you use it.

### Pepperbox

A small pistol with four separate barrels, each loaded with its own round.

### Revolver

A single-action revolver with a turning cylinder containing multiple chambers. Before firing, the hammer must be cocked to align the barrel with the next round.

### Lever-Action Rifle

A lever-action long-rifle which uses a lever built into the trigger guard to chamber the next round out of the large magazine hosted under the barrel.

### Bolt-Action Rifle

This bolt-action hunting rifle has an internal magazine, where you can load up to five cartridges which are handled in and out of the barrel chamber by manually operating a bolt via the bolt handle on the weapon’s right-hand side.

### Long-Bore Rifle

An experimental, heavy caliber breechloading firearm, used to hunt large game, such as oxen or elephants. This weapon requires a special cartridge that costs and weighs twice as much as an ordinary cartridge.

### Cartridge

A single cartridge where the charge and the bullet are packed into one jacket is the proper ammunition for all advanced firearms.

## Firearm Ammunition

All firearms require ammunition to make an attack, and due to their rare nature, ammunition may be near impossible to find or purchase. However, if materials are gathered, you can craft ammunition yourself using your Tinker’s Tools at half the cost. Each firearm uses its own unique ammunition and is generally sold or crafted in batches listed below next to the price.

## Firearm Properties

### Reload

A weapon with the Reload property can be fired a number of times equal to its reload score before you must take a [[Actions#Utilize|Utilize]] action to reload it. You must have one free hand to reload a firearm.

### Misfire

Whenever you make an attack roll with a firearm, and the dice roll is equal to or lower than the weapon’s misfire score, the weapon misfires. The attack misses, and the weapon cannot be used again until you take a utilize action to try and repair it. To repair your firearm, you must make a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check with [[Tools#Tinker’s Tools|Tinker's Tools]] (DC equal to 8 + the weapon’s misfire score). If your check fails, the weapon is broken and must be mended out of combat over a short or long rest at a quarter of the cost of the firearm. Creatures who use a firearm without being proficient increase the weapon’s misfire score by 1.

### Explosive

Upon a hit with a weapon with the Explosive property, everything within 5 foot radius [[Spells#Sphere|Sphere]] of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw (DC equal to 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Dexterity modifier) or suffer 1d8 fire damage. If the weapon misses, the ammunition fails to detonate, or bounces away harmlessly before doing so.

### Artillery

Loading an artillery weapon requires one or more creatures to use a number of [[Actions#Utilize|Utilize]] actions equal to the weapon’s artillery score. You must have two free hands to load an artillery weapon. Once loaded, an artillery weapon can be aimed and shot like any other firearm.

## Firearm Upgrades

Anyone tinkering with firearms might find themselves wanting to upgrade them to serve certain functions. The formula for how much an upgrade costs is as follows:

<p style="text-align:center;font-family:Computer Modern"><b>Upgrade Cost</b> = <i>Weapon Cost ⋅ 1/2 + 100 GP</i></p>

Upgrading a weapon can be done over the course of 40 hours. After that time, the tinkerer makes a DC 15 Intelligence (Investigation) check with [[Tools#Tinker’s Tools|Tinker's Tools]]. On a success, the upgrade is applied. On a failure, it takes another 40 hours before the upgrade is completed. A second roll is not required.

### Stub

Ranged attacks made with this firearm while within 5 ft. of a hostile creature do not have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on the attack roll.

### Muffled

This weapon’s barrel has several vents that release pressure in a gradual manner, significantly reducing the volume of the gunshot. Creatures more than 100 ft away can’t hear the sound of this weapon firing.

### Scoped

Attacking at long range doesn’t impose [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on your ranged attack rolls with this firearm.

Installing this upgrade requires you to have a [[Adventuring Gear#Spyglass|Spyglass]] that you attach to the weapon as part of the upgrade process.

### Lightweight

Removes the [[Weapons#Heavy|Heavy]] property from a firearm. If the weapon does not have the heavy property, remove the [[Weapons#Two-Handed|Two-Handed]] property instead. If it has neither, give it the [[Weapons#Light|Light]] property. You cannot apply this upgrade to a weapon more than once.

### Kalterlock

You upgrade a weapon with the [[#Reload]] 1 property to instead be [[Weapons#Loading|Loading]].
