# Suffering Domain

![[suffering-domain.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]The Suffering Domain embodies the divine acknowledgment that pain is an inescapable part of mortal existence. Clerics of this domain are conduits for anguish. Either embracing torment to shield others or wielding it as a force for profound change. Some seek to bear the weight of others' wounds, offering themselves as vessels of compassion and sacrifice. Others walk darker paths, meting out suffering to reveal truths, force reflection, or exact penance.

This domain is associated with gods of endurance, grief, sacrifice, and redemption; deities who understand that pain can purify, transform, and heal. Religious orders of this domain often arise in war-torn lands, plague-ridden regions, or among the destitute, where they offer solace not through comfort, but through shared pain and unflinching presence. Whether saint or scourge, a cleric of the Suffering Domain knows that the path to salvation often runs through shadowed valleys.

## Level 3: Suffering Domain Spells

Your connection to this divine domain ensures you always have certain spells ready. When you reach a Cleric level specified in the Suffering Domain Spells table, you thereafter always have the listed spells prepared.

| Cleric Level | Prepared Spells                                                             |

## Level 3: Well of Suffering

You have the ability to store the pain and suffering of others. Your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] can store a max amount equal to 10 x your Cleric Level. When your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] fills, you begin to [[Spells#Concentration|Concentrate]] as if on a spell—losing any [[Spells#Concentration|Concentraiton]] you have on any current spells. While full, any absorbed damage over your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] maximum is instead taken as necrotic damage. This damage cannot be reduced in any way.

This concentration follows the normal rules for spell concentration. Upon losing this concentration, you immediately transform into your [[#Level 3 Avatar of Woe|Avatar of Woe]] and go berserk.

## Level 3: Aegis of Penance

When a creature you can see within 30 feet of you takes damage, you can take a [[Actions#Reactions|Reaction]] to half the damage taken by the creature. You add an amount of damage to your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] equal to the damage reduced.

## Level 3: Avatar of Woe

You give yourself over to the well of suffering and become an embodiment of pain and woe itself. As a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], you transform into an Avatar of Woe and gain temporary HP equal to the current value of your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]].

Your transformation follows the rules below:

***Duration.*** This transformation lasts until either you run out of temporary HP, you fall unconscious, or you use another [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]] to end it. Once the transformation ends, any remaining temporary HP you have is transferred back to your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]].

***No Concentraiton or Spells.*** You cannot maintain concentration or cast spells.

***Increased Speed.*** Your speed increases by 10 feet and you may take the [[Actions#Dash|Dash Action]] as a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]].

***Talons of Ruin.*** When you make an [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes|Unarmed Strike]], your bonus to the roll is equal to your Spell Attack Modifier. When you hit with an [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes|Unarmed Strike]] and deal damage, you can deal 3d6 necrotic damage instead of the normal damage of an [[Combat#Unarmed Strikes|Unarmed Strike]].

***Taking Damage.*** Whenever you take damage while transformed, make a DC 13 Constitution saving throw. On failure you enter a Berserker State.

***Berserker State.*** While Berserking, you can no longer use a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]] to end the transformation. Additionally, you regard the creature nearest to you that you can see or hear as your enemy. If there are multiple possible creatures, choose one at random. On each of your turns, you must move as close to the creature as possible and take the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action, targeting the creature. If you’re unable to get close enough to the creature to attack it, your turn ends after you’ve used up all your available movement. If the creature dies or can no longer be seen or heard by you, the next nearest creature that you can see or hear becomes your new target.

## Level 5: Improved Avatar of Woe

While transformed, you can attack twice instead of once whenever you take the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn.

## Level 6: Martyrs Benediction

As a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], you may add 10 damage to your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] to end one of the following conditions effecting a creature you can see within 30 feet: [[Conditions#Blinded|Blinded]], [[Conditions#Charmed|Charmed]], [[Conditions#Deafened|Deafened]], [[Conditions#Paralyzed|Paralyzed]], [[Conditions#Poisoned|Poisoned]], or [[Conditions#Stunned|Stunned]].

## Level 9: Improved Aegis of Penance

The range of your [[#Level 3 Aegis of Penance|Aegis of Penance]] increases to 60 feet.

## Level 11: Perfect Avatar of Woe

While transformed, you can attack three times instead of once whenever you take the [[Actions#Attack|Attack]] action on your turn.

## Level 17: Burden of the Masses

When 2 or more creatures you can see within 60 feet of you takes damage from the same source at the same time, you can take a [[Actions#Reactions|Reaction]] to half the damage taken by all creatures. Add damage to your [[#Level 3 Well of Suffering|Well of Suffering Pool]] equal to 10 x the number of creatures protected.
