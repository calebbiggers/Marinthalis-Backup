# Mathemagician

![[mathemagician.jpg|float-right|relative|ws-med|border]]Mathemagicians view the world through the lens of mathematics, seeing the complex formulae and equations that govern the interactions of both the physical world and magical spells. They use their knowledge of underlying mathematical principles to alter these functions, augmenting their spells.

## Level 3: Calculation Savant

You can determine the optimal way to perform a task by spending at least 1 uninterrupted minute performing mathemagical calculations. When you finish the calculations, you touch one creature and fill its mind with mathemagical knowledge of a task you describe for 1 hour or until it is targeted by this feature again. If the target makes an ability check to perform that task while it holds this knowledge, it adds your Intelligence modifier (minimum +1) to the check, and then the knowledge fades away.

You can perform the calculations for longer to optimize them further: the bonus increases by 1 for each additional 10 minutes of calculations. This extra bonus cannot exceed half your Wizard level (round up).

## Level 3: Mathemagics

You can use your mathemagical talents to alter an aspect of a Wizard spell that you cast in one of the following ways. You can apply an effect only once per turn. You can use one of these effects a number of times equal to your Intelligence modifier (minimum once) and you regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]]. When you use your [[Wizard#Level 1 Arcane Recovery|Arcane Recovery]] feature, you can regain up to half of your total uses (round up).

**_Fractalize._** When you roll damage for a spell, if you roll a 1 on any of the damage dice, you can use your Mathemagics to roll another die of the same type and add it to the damage for each 1 rolled. This process repeats if those dice also roll 1s, and so on.

**_Shift Origin._** When you cast a spell, you can use your Mathemagics to move its point of origin to a point you can see. The maximum distance the point can be from yourself is a number of feet equal to 10 times your Intelligence modifier (minimum 10 feet). If the spell lasts more than one round and would normally move with you, the spell's point of origin snaps back to your position at the start of your next

## Level 6: Advanced Mathematics

The  following options are added to your Mathemagics feature:

**_Alter Geometry._** When you create a [[Spells#Cone|Cone]], [[Spells#Cube|Cube]], [[Spells#Line|Line]] or [[Spells#Sphere|Sphere]] area of effect with a spell, you can use your [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] to change the shape of that area of effect to one of the others. Use the Alter Geometry table to determine the new area of effect's range and size. For the purposes of using the table, consider the side length of a Cube to be equivalent to 2x the radius of a Sphere (i.e. its diameter)

### Alter Geometry Table

| Shape       | New Shape   | New Range          | New Size                                    |
| ----------- | ----------- | ----------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Cone        | Cube/Sphere | = Original Size   | Radius = ¼ ⋅ Original Size                    |
| Cone        | Line        | Self              | Width = 5 feet, Length = 2 ⋅ Original Size   |
| Cube/Sphere | Cone        | Self              | Size = 4x Original Radius                  |
| Cube/Sphere | Line        | Self              | Width = 5 feet, Length = 4 ⋅ Original Radius |
| Line        | Cone        | Self              | Size = ½ ⋅ Original Length                    |
| Line        | Cube/Sphere | = Original Length | Radius = ¼ ⋅ Original Length                  |

**_Infinitesimal Spell._** When you cast a spell with an Instantaneous [[Spells#Duration|Duration]] that provides a saving throw to creatures in an area of effect, instead of creating that area you can use your [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] to condense the spell's effects to an infinitely small iota and fire it at a single target. Make a ranged spell attack against one creature that would have been in the spell's area of effect. On a hit, the target is affected by the spell, and is considered to have failed its saving throw (though features like Legendary Resistance can still be used to change the outcome. On a critical hit, roll any damage dice again and add them to the damage total, as normal for a critical hit. After the initial impact, the target is affected by the spell normally.

## Level 10: Equation Vision

 As a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], you can open your mind to seeing the world as a mess of arcane and mathematical equations. You gain the following benefits for 10 minutes, or until you end the effect (no action required).

**_Truesight._** You have [[Exploration#Truesight|Truesight]] to a range of 60 feet.

**_Equation Reading._** Whenever you fail a [[D20 Tests|D20 Test]], you can take a [[Actions#Reactions|Reaction]] to focus on the relevant equations and reroll it, and you must use the new roll.

Once you use this [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], you can't use it again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Short Rests|Short]] or [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]].

## Level 14: Mathemagical Laureate

You are now no longer limited in the number of [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] effects you can use on a turn.

In addition, you gain two special [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] options. These options are more complex and thus more taxing to use: once you use one, you can't use either option again until you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]], though it doesn't count against the uses of your [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] feature. You can restore its use by spending a level 5+ spell slot (no action required).

**_Complex Function._** When you cast a spell, you can use your [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] to extend its effect into the imaginary domain for that casting, causing it to manifest through space in strange and unexpected ways. The spell can affect creatures in the Ethereal Plane, and you do not need a clear path to the spell's targets, allowing the spell to ignore [[Combat#Cover|Cover]] (including [[Combat#Total Cover|Total Cover]]) and any requirement to see a target. In addition, you gain a 1d6 bonus to attack rolls made with the spell, and its targets suffer a 1d6 penalty to their saving throws to avoid or end its effects.

**_Compound Function._** You can break down a complex spell into two simpler ones. When you cast a spell with a level 3+ spell slot, instead of producing the effects of that spell, you can use your [[#Level 3 Mathemagics|Mathemagics]] to produce the effects of two other Wizard spells you have prepared. The new spells must be similar to the original: they must have the same spell school and the same casting time, and their combined levels must be equal to or less than the spent spell slot.
