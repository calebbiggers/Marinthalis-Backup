# Goblinoids

## Types of Goblinoids

### Goblins

![[goblin.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]A subterranean folk, goblins can be found in every corner of the multiverse, often beside their [[#Bugbears|Bugbear]] and [[#Hobgoblins|Hobgoblin]] kin. Long before the god Maglubiyet conquered them, early goblins served in the court of the Queen of Air and Darkness, one of the Feywild’s archfey. Goblins thrived in her dangerous domain thanks to a special boon from her—a supernatural knack for finding the weak spots in foes larger than themselves and for getting out of trouble. Goblins brought this fey boon with them to worlds across the Material Plane, even if they don’t remember the fey realm they inhabited before Maglubiyet’s rise. Now many goblins pursue their own destinies, escaping the plots of both archfey and gods.

#### Goblin Traits

**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size:** Small (about 2–4 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Goblin, you have these special traits.

**_Darkvision._** You have [[Exploration#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.

**_Fey Ancestry._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition.

**_Fury of the Small._** When you damage a creature with an attack or a spell and the creature’s size is larger than yours, you can cause the attack or spell to deal extra damage to the creature. The extra damage equals your proficiency bonus.

You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, regaining all expended uses when you finish a long rest, and you can use it no more than once per turn.

**_Nimble Escape._** You can take the [[Actions#Disengage|Disengage]] or [[Actions#Hide|Hide]] action as a bonus action on each of your turns.

### Hobgoblins

![[hobgoblin.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Hobgoblins trace their origins to the ancient courts of the Feywild, where they first appeared with their [[#Goblins|Goblin]] and [[#Bugbears|Bugbear]] kin. Many of them were driven from the Feywild by the conquering god Maglubiyet, who marshaled them as soldiers, but the fey realm left its mark; wherever they are in the multiverse, they continue to channel an aspect of the Feywild’s rule of reciprocity, which creates a mystical bond between the giver and the receiver of a gift.

On some worlds, such bonds lead hobgoblins to form communities with deep ties to one another. In Eberron and the Forgotten Realms, vast hobgoblin legions have emerged, with ranks of devoted soldiers famed for their unity.

Hobgoblins are generally taller than their goblin cousins but not quite as big as bugbears. They have curved, pointed ears and noses that turn bright red or blue during displays of emotion.

#### Hobgoblin Traits

**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size:** Medium (about 4-5 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Hobgoblin, you have these special traits.

**_Darkvision._** You have [[Exploration#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.

**_Fey Ancestry._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition.

**_Fey Gift._** You can use this trait to take the [[Actions#Help|Help]] action as a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], and you can do so a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus. You regain all expended uses when you finish a [[Damage & Healing#Long Rests|Long Rest]].

Starting at 3rd level, choose one of the options below each time you take the [[Actions#Help|Help]] action with this trait:
>**_Hospitality._** You and the creature you help each gain a number of [[Damage & Healing#Temporary Hit Points|Temporary Hit Points]] equal to 1d6 plus your proficiency bonus.
>
>**_Passage._** You and the creature you help each increase your walking speeds by 10 feet until the start of your next turn.
>
>**_Spite._** Until the start of your next turn, the first time the creature you help hits a target with an attack roll, that target has [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage|Disadvantage]] on the next attack roll it makes within the next minute.

**_Fortune of the Many._** If you miss with an attack roll or fail an ability check or a saving throw, you can draw on your bonds of reciprocity to gain a bonus to the roll equal to the number of allies you can see within 30 feet of you (maximum bonus of +3). You can use this trait a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

### Bugbears

![[bugbear.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Neither bugs nor bears, bugbears are the hulking cousins of goblins and hobgoblins. With roots in the Feywild, early bugbears resided in hidden places, in hard-to-reach and shadowed spaces. Long ago and from out of the corner of your eye, they came to the Material Plane, urged to spread throughout the multiverse by the conquering god Maglubiyet. Centuries later, they still bear a fey gift for lurking just out of sight, and many of them have sneaked away from that god’s influence.

They are long of limb and covered in coarse hair, with wedge-shaped ears and pointed teeth. Despite their formidable build, bugbears are quiet skulkers, thanks to a fey magic that allows them to hide in spaces seemingly too small for them.

#### Bugbear Traits

**Creature Type:** Fey
**Size:** Medium (about 5-6 feet tall)
**Speed:** 30 feet

As a Bugbear, you have these special traits.

**_Darkvision._** You have [[Exploration#Darkvision|Darkvision]] with a range of 60 feet.

**_Fey Ancestry._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on saving throws you make to avoid or end the [[Conditions#Charmed\|Charmed]] condition.

**_Long-Limbed._** When you make a melee attack on your turn, your reach for it is 5 feet greater than normal.

**_Powerful Build._** You have [[D20 Tests#Advantage/Disadvantage\|Advantage]] on any ability check you make to end the [[Conditions#Grappled\|Grappled]] condition. You also count as one size larger when determining your carrying capacity.

**_Sneaky._** You are proficient in the [[Proficiency#Skill List|Stealth]] skill. In addition, without squeezing, you can move through and stop in a space large enough for a Small creature.

**_Surprise Attack._** If you hit a creature with an attack roll, the creature takes an extra 2d6 damage if it hasn’t taken a turn yet in the current combat.
