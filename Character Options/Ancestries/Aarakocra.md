# Aarakocra

![[aarakocra-2.png]]
A winged people descendant of the Animal Lords of [[The Beastlands]], over time Aarakocra have spread throughout [[The Material Plane]], the [[Elemental Plane of Air]], and the other [[Inner Planes]].

From afar, Aarakocra look like large birds and thus are sometimes called Birdfolk. Only when they roost on a branch or walk across the ground is their Humanoid nature clear. Aarakocra are as varied as the avians to which they are related. With both flighted and flightless lineages, aarakocra come in many shapes and sizes.

## Types of Aarakocra

### Kenku

![[kenku-aarakocra.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Feathered folk who resemble ravens or crows, Kenku Aarakocra are blessed with keen observation and supernaturally accurate memories. Some Kenku paint their genesis as a curse, being a flightless bird people doomed to mimic other people’s creations. Other Kenku recite cryptic but beautiful poems about their advent being a blessed event in which they were sent into the multiverse to observe and catalog its many wonders.

Kenku are most often found in [[The Shadowfell]] and [[The Material Plane]], and they tend to have the darker colorations or patterns.

As a Kenku Aarakocra, you have these special traits.

**_Expert Duplication._** When you copy writing or craftwork produced by yourself or someone else, you have advantage on any ability checks you make to produce an exact duplicate.

**_Kenku Recall._** Thanks to your supernaturally good memory, you have proficiency in two skills of your choice.

Moreover, when you make an ability check using any skill in which you have proficiency, you can give yourself advantage on the check before rolling the d20. You can give yourself advantage in this way a number of times equal to your proficiency bonus, and you regain all expended uses when you finish a long rest.

**_Mimicry._** You can accurately mimic sounds you have heard, including voices. A creature that hears the sounds you make can tell they are imitations only with a successful Wisdom ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Insight]]) check against a DC of 8 + your proficiency bonus + your Charisma modifier.

_**Skulker.**_ You have advantage on Dexterity ([[Proficiency#Skill List|Stealth]]) checks made in [[Exploration#Dim Light|Dim Light]] or [[Exploration#Darkness|Darkness]].

### Owlin

![[owlin-aarakocra.png]]
A distant kin of owls, Owlin Aarakocra come in many shapes and sizes, from petite and fluffy to wide-winged and majestic. Owlin have arms and legs like other Aarakocra, as well as wings that extend from their back and shoulders.

Like owls, Owlin are graced with feathers that make no sound when they move or fly, making it easy for them to sneak up on others. Some Owlin are nocturnal, other are simply prone to rise later, embodying the common nickname of night owl.

**_Flight._** Because of your wings, you have a [[Combat#Fly Speed|Fly Speed]] equal to your walking speed. You can’t use this flying speed if you’re wearing medium or heavy armor.

**_Silent Feathers._** You have [[Proficiency]] in the [[Proficiency#Skill List|Stealth]] skill.

**_Talons._** You have talons that you can use to make unarmed strikes. When you hit with them, the strike deals 1d6 + your Strength modifier slashing damage, instead of the bludgeoning damage normal for an unarmed strike.

### Gallus

Gallus Aarakocra resemble roosters or hens, and like the [[#Kenku]], are flightless. Gallus are a social and communal folk. They tend to form close-knit communities wherever they roost, and their sense of pride for their community runs deep. Gallus value honest work, such as farming and smithing, and share labor equally between all community members. There is nothing a Gallus would not give to their neighbors in a time of need.

While others might look down on Gallus for their common ways, the Gallus have excellent interpersonal skills. They are insightful and empathetic, but not to the point of being socially exploitable. The Gallus have an ear for the truth, and are often capable of rooting out lies and dishonesty.

**_Glide._** Using your feathered arms, you can slow your fall, and glide short distances. When falling you can use your reaction to spread your arms, stiffen your wing feathers, and slow your descent. While doing so, you continue to fall gently at a speed of 60 feet per round, taking no fall damage when you land. If you would fall at least 10 feet in this way, you may fly up to your movement speed in one direction you choose, although you cannot choose to move upwards, landing in the space you finish your movement. You cannot glide while carrying heavy weapons or wielding a shield (though you may drop any held items as part of your reaction to spread your arms). You cannot glide while wearing heavy armor, or if you are encumbered.

**_Inspiring._** By giving words of advice or encouragement, you can inspire an ally who is able to see and hear you. You may cast the [[Guidance]] spell with this trait. This instance of the [[Guidance]] spell has a range of 30 feet.

**_Understanding._** You have proficiency in the [[Proficiency#Skill List|insight]] skill.

**_Wing Flap._** As a [[Actions#Bonus Actions|Bonus Action]], you can use your powerful feathered arms to propel yourself upward a distance equal to half your movement speed. You can use it in conjunction with a regular jump, but not while gliding.

### Luma

![[luma-aarakocra.png|float-right|relative|ws-med]]Luma are smaller than most birdfolk, often resembling doves, pigeons, peacocks or other vibrant avians. Many have ruffs of feathers that shine with unique iridescent colors, something which can be seen as either alluring or unusual.

Luma are often natural performers, using their colored feathers to aid in song and dance.

Intelligence, Wisdom, or Charisma is your spellcasting ability for it when you cast [[Charm Person]] with this trait (choose when you select this race).

### Raptor

![[raptor-aarakocra.png|float-right|relative|wmed]]Resembling small hawks, eagles, and other birds of prey, they have sharp talons and agile builds that help them effortlessly glide through the canopy. These birdfolk are swift and strong with an uncanny knack for tracking. They are rarely prey, and are quick to turn the tables when finding themselves hunted.

Given their heightened senses, often Raptors appear to be distracted or deep in thought. In reality, they are processing the wealth of sensory information they receive from their particularly keen eyes and sensitive ears. While many folk are only ever aware of what goes on directly around them, Raptors have an extremely wide field of awareness.

**_Wind Caller._** Starting at 3rd level, you can cast the [[Gust of Wind]] spell with this trait, without requiring a material component. Once you cast the spell with this trait, you can’t do so again until you finish a long rest. You can also cast the spell using any spell slots you have of 2nd level or higher.
