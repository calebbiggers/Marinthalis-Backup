No one suspects you, and that’s exactly what you need to do your job. Your life is full of secrets, some of your own and some belonging to others. You have learned to move in shadows, to hear what others shouldn't know, and to disappear without a trace. Disguises, cunning, and patience are your tools, and you know how to manipulate information to keep yourself always one step ahead. You understand truth better than most, and the power it brings can be both a blessing and a curse.
