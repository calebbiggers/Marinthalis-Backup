# Thirsting Blade Dark Excalibur Mega-Genesis

Weapon that is really big and hard to wielâ€” a la Guts sword. Huge benefits but huge downsides:
- -2 to attack rolls
- +30 to damage rolls
- Must succeed on a DC 15 Athletics check to use as an attack action.
- All attack rolls are made at disadvantage
- On a Nat 20, deals an additional 12d10 Necrotic damage, and you regain that many hit points
- Imposes disadvantage on all Dexterity based checks and saving throws while wielded.
