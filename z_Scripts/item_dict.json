Thus, only a few of these weapons remain.\n",

If you're accepted by the weapon and try to attune to it, you become attuned to it instantly, and a new rune appears on it. You remain attuned to the weapon until you die or the weapon is destroyed. A _Moonblade_ functions like a nonmagical weapon of its kind for anyone other than its chosen bearer.\n",
